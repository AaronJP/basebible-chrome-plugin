<h1>1 Corinthians 11</h1><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.</span></p><h2>Propriety in Worship</h2><p/><p><span><b>2</b>I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the teachings, just as I passed them on to you.</span><span><b>3</b>Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.</span><span><b>4</b>Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.</span><span><b>5</b>And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head–it is just as though her head were shaved.</span><span><b>6</b>If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head.</span><span><b>7</b>A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.</span><span><b>8</b>For man did not come from woman, but woman from man;</span><span><b>9</b>neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.</span><span><b>11</b>In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.</span><span><b>12</b>For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.</span><span><b>13</b>Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?</span><span><b>14</b>Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him,</span><span><b>15</b>but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering.</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice–nor do the churches of God.</span></p><h2>The Lord's Supper</h2><p><span><b>17</b>In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good.</span><span><b>18</b>In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it.</span><span><b>19</b>No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval.</span><span><b>20</b>When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat,</span><span><b>21</b>for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk.</span></p><p><span><b>22</b>Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not!</span><span><b>23</b>For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread,</span><span><b>24</b>and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.”</span><span><b>25</b>In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.”</span></p><p><span><b>26</b>For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.</span><span><b>27</b>Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.</span><span><b>28</b>A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup.</span><span><b>29</b>For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.</span><span><b>30</b>That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.</span><span><b>31</b>But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment.</span></p><p><span><b>32</b>When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world.</span><span><b>33</b>So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>34</b>If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment.<br/>And when I come I will give further directions.</span></p>

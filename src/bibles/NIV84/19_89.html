<h1>Psalm 89</h1><h2>A maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite.</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>I will sing of the Lord's great love forever;<br/>with my mouth I will make your faithfulness known through all generations.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>I will declare that your love stands firm forever,<br/>that you established your faithfulness in heaven itself.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>You said, “I have made a covenant with my chosen one,<br/>I have sworn to David my servant,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>‘I will establish your line forever<br/>and make your throne firm through all generations.’ ”<br/>Selah</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>The heavens praise your wonders, O Lord,<br/>your faithfulness too, in the assembly of the holy ones.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>6</b>For who in the skies above can compare with the Lord?<br/>Who is like the Lord among the heavenly beings?</span></p><p/><p><span><b>7</b>In the council of the holy ones God is greatly feared;<br/>he is more awesome than all who surround him.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>O Lord God Almighty, who is like you?<br/>You are mighty, O Lord, and your faithfulness surrounds you.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>9</b>You rule over the surging sea;<br/>when its waves mount up, you still them.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>10</b>You crushed Rahab like one of the slain;<br/>with your strong arm you scattered your enemies.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>11</b>The heavens are yours, and yours also the earth;<br/>you founded the world and all that is in it.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>12</b>You created the north and the south;<br/>Tabor and Hermon sing for joy at your name.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>Your arm is endued with power;<br/>your hand is strong, your right hand exalted.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>14</b>Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne;<br/>love and faithfulness go before you.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>15</b>Blessed are those who have learned to acclaim you,<br/>who walk in the light of your presence, O Lord.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>16</b>They rejoice in your name all day long;<br/>they exult in your righteousness.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>17</b>For you are their glory and strength,<br/>and by your favor you exalt our horn.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>Indeed, our shield belongs to the Lord,<br/>our king to the Holy One of Israel.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>Once you spoke in a vision,<br/>to your faithful people you said:<br/>“I have bestowed strength on a warrior;<br/>I have exalted a young man from among the people.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>20</b>I have found David my servant;<br/>with my sacred oil I have anointed him.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>21</b>My hand will sustain him;<br/>surely my arm will strengthen him.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>22</b>No enemy will subject him to tribute;<br/>no wicked man will oppress him.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>23</b>I will crush his foes before him<br/>and strike down his adversaries.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>24</b>My faithful love will be with him,<br/>and through my name his horn will be exalted.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>25</b>I will set his hand over the sea,<br/>his right hand over the rivers.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>26</b>He will call out to me, ‘You are my Father,<br/>my God, the Rock my Savior.’</span></p><p/><p><span><b>27</b>I will also appoint him my firstborn,<br/>the most exalted of the kings of the earth.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>28</b>I will maintain my love to him forever,<br/>and my covenant with him will never fail.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>29</b>I will establish his line forever,<br/>his throne as long as the heavens endure.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>30</b>“If his sons forsake my law<br/>and do not follow my statutes,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>31</b>if they violate my decrees<br/>and fail to keep my commands,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>32</b>I will punish their sin with the rod,<br/>their iniquity with flogging;</span></p><p/><p><span><b>33</b>but I will not take my love from him,<br/>nor will I ever betray my faithfulness.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>34</b>I will not violate my covenant<br/>or alter what my lips have uttered.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>35</b>Once for all, I have sworn by my holiness—<br/>and I will not lie to David—</span></p><p/><p><span><b>36</b>that his line will continue forever<br/>and his throne endure before me like the sun;</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>37</b>it will be established forever like the moon,<br/>the faithful witness in the sky.”<br/>Selah</span></p><p/><p><span><b>38</b>But you have rejected, you have spurned,<br/>you have been very angry with your anointed one.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>39</b>You have renounced the covenant with your servant<br/>and have defiled his crown in the dust.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>40</b>You have broken through all his walls<br/>and reduced his strongholds to ruins.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>41</b>All who pass by have plundered him;<br/>he has become the scorn of his neighbors.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>42</b>You have exalted the right hand of his foes;<br/>you have made all his enemies rejoice.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>43</b>You have turned back the edge of his sword<br/>and have not supported him in battle.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>44</b>You have put an end to his splendor<br/>and cast his throne to the ground.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>45</b>You have cut short the days of his youth;<br/>you have covered him with a mantle of shame.<br/>Selah</span></p><p/><p><span><b>46</b>How long, O Lord? Will you hide yourself forever?<br/>How long will your wrath burn like fire?</span></p><p/><p><span><b>47</b>Remember how fleeting is my life.<br/>For what futility you have created all men!</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>48</b>What man can live and not see death,<br/>or save himself from the power of the grave?<br/>Selah</span></p><p/><p><span><b>49</b>O Lord, where is your former great love,<br/>which in your faithfulness you swore to David?</span></p><p/><p><span><b>50</b>Remember, Lord, how your servant has been mocked,<br/>how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the nations,</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>51</b>the taunts with which your enemies have mocked, O Lord,<br/>with which they have mocked every step of your anointed one.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>52</b>Praise be to the Lord forever!<br/>Amen and Amen.</span></p>

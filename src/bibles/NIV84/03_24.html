<h1>Leviticus 24</h1><h2>Oil and Bread Set Before the Lord</h2><p><span><b>1</b>The Lord said to Moses,</span><span><b>2</b>“Command the Israelites to bring you clear oil of pressed olives for the light so that the lamps may be kept burning continually.</span><span><b>3</b>Outside the curtain of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron is to tend the lamps before the Lord from evening till morning, continually. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.</span></p><p><span><b>4</b>The lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the Lord must be tended continually.</span><span><b>5</b>“Take fine flour and bake twelve loaves of bread, using two-tenths of an ephah for each loaf.</span><span><b>6</b>Set them in two rows, six in each row, on the table of pure gold before the Lord.</span><span><b>7</b>Along each row put some pure incense as a memorial portion to represent the bread and to be an offering made to the Lord by fire.</span><span><b>8</b>This bread is to be set out before the Lord regularly, Sabbath after Sabbath, on behalf of the Israelites, as a lasting covenant.</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>It belongs to Aaron and his sons, who are to eat it in a holy place, because it is a most holy part of their regular share of the offerings made to the Lord by fire.”</span></p><h2>A Blasphemer Stoned</h2><p><span><b>10</b>Now the son of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father went out among the Israelites, and a fight broke out in the camp between him and an Israelite.</span><span><b>11</b>The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name with a curse; so they brought him to Moses. (His mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri the Danite.)</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>They put him in custody until the will of the Lord should be made clear to them.</span><span><b>13</b>Then the Lord said to Moses:</span><span><b>14</b>“Take the blasphemer outside the camp. All those who heard him are to lay their hands on his head, and the entire assembly is to stone him.</span><span><b>15</b>Say to the Israelites: ‘If anyone curses his God, he will be held responsible;</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>anyone who blasphemes the name of the Lord must be put to death. The entire assembly must stone him. Whether an alien or native-born, when he blasphemes the Name, he must be put to death.</span><span><b>17</b>“ ‘If anyone takes the life of a human being, he must be put to death.</span><span><b>18</b>Anyone who takes the life of someone’s animal must make restitution—life for life.</span><span><b>19</b>If anyone injures his neighbor, whatever he has done must be done to him:</span><span><b>20</b>fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. As he has injured the other, so he is to be injured.</span><span><b>21</b>Whoever kills an animal must make restitution, but whoever kills a man must be put to death.</span></p><p><span><b>22</b>You are to have the same law for the alien and the native-born. I am the Lord your God.’ ”</span></p><p><span><b>23</b>Then Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him. The Israelites did as the Lord commanded Moses.</span></p>

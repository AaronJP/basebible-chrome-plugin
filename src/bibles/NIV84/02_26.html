<h1>Exodus 26</h1><h2>The Tabernacle</h2><p><span><b>1</b>“Make the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, with cherubim worked into them by a skilled craftsman.</span><span><b>2</b>All the curtains are to be the same size—twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide.</span><span><b>3</b>Join five of the curtains together, and do the same with the other five.</span><span><b>4</b>Make loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and do the same with the end curtain in the other set.</span><span><b>5</b>Make fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the other set, with the loops opposite each other.</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>Then make fifty gold clasps and use them to fasten the curtains together so that the tabernacle is a unit.</span><span><b>7</b>“Make curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle—eleven altogether.</span><span><b>8</b>All eleven curtains are to be the same size—thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.</span><span><b>9</b>Join five of the curtains together into one set and the other six into another set. Fold the sixth curtain double at the front of the tent.</span><span><b>10</b>Make fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set and also along the edge of the end curtain in the other set.</span><span><b>11</b>Then make fifty bronze clasps and put them in the loops to fasten the tent together as a unit.</span><span><b>12</b>As for the additional length of the tent curtains, the half curtain that is left over is to hang down at the rear of the tabernacle.</span><span><b>13</b>The tent curtains will be a cubit longer on both sides; what is left will hang over the sides of the tabernacle so as to cover it.</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>Make for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of hides of sea cows.</span><span><b>15</b>“Make upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.</span><span><b>16</b>Each frame is to be ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide,</span><span><b>17</b>with two projections set parallel to each other. Make all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.</span><span><b>18</b>Make twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle</span><span><b>19</b>and make forty silver bases to go under them—two bases for each frame, one under each projection.</span><span><b>20</b>For the other side, the north side of the tabernacle, make twenty frames</span><span><b>21</b>and forty silver bases—two under each frame.</span><span><b>22</b>Make six frames for the far end, that is, the west end of the tabernacle,</span><span><b>23</b>and make two frames for the corners at the far end.</span><span><b>24</b>At these two corners they must be double from the bottom all the way to the top, and fitted into a single ring; both shall be like that.</span></p><p><span><b>25</b>So there will be eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame.</span><span><b>26</b>“Also make crossbars of acacia wood: five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,</span><span><b>27</b>five for those on the other side, and five for the frames on the west, at the far end of the tabernacle.</span><span><b>28</b>The center crossbar is to extend from end to end at the middle of the frames.</span></p><p><span><b>29</b>Overlay the frames with gold and make gold rings to hold the crossbars. Also overlay the crossbars with gold.</span></p><p><span><b>30</b>“Set up the tabernacle according to the plan shown you on the mountain.</span><span><b>31</b>“Make a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, with cherubim worked into it by a skilled craftsman.</span><span><b>32</b>Hang it with gold hooks on four posts of acacia wood overlaid with gold and standing on four silver bases.</span><span><b>33</b>Hang the curtain from the clasps and place the ark of the Testimony behind the curtain. The curtain will separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place.</span><span><b>34</b>Put the atonement cover on the ark of the Testimony in the Most Holy Place.</span></p><p><span><b>35</b>Place the table outside the curtain on the north side of the tabernacle and put the lampstand opposite it on the south side.</span><span><b>36</b>“For the entrance to the tent make a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen—the work of an embroiderer.</span></p><p><span><b>37</b>Make gold hooks for this curtain and five posts of acacia wood overlaid with gold. And cast five bronze bases for them.</span></p>

Distribute it according to your ancestral tribes.</span><span><b>55</b>“ ‘But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land, those you allow to remain will become barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides. They will give you trouble in the land where you will live.</span></p><p><span><b>56</b>And then I will do to you what I plan to do to them.’ ”</span></p>

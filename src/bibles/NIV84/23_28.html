<h1>Isaiah 28</h1><h2>Woe to Ephraim</h2><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Woe to that wreath, the pride of Ephraim's drunkards,<br/>to the fading flower, his glorious beauty,<br/>set on the head of a fertile valley—<br/>to that city, the pride of those laid low by wine!</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>See, the Lord has one who is powerful and strong.<br/>Like a hailstorm and a destructive wind,<br/>like a driving rain and a flooding downpour,<br/>he will throw it forcefully to the ground.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>That wreath, the pride of Ephraim's drunkards,<br/>will be trampled underfoot.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>That fading flower, his glorious beauty,<br/>set on the head of a fertile valley,<br/>will be like a fig ripe before harvest—<br/>as soon as someone sees it and takes it in his hand,<br/>he swallows it.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>In that day the Lord Almighty<br/>will be a glorious crown,<br/>a beautiful wreath<br/>for the remnant of his people.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>He will be a spirit of justice<br/>to him who sits in judgment,<br/>a source of strength<br/>to those who turn back the battle at the gate.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>And these also stagger from wine<br/>and reel from beer:<br/>Priests and prophets stagger from beer<br/>and are befuddled with wine;<br/>they reel from beer,<br/>they stagger when seeing visions,<br/>they stumble when rendering decisions.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>All the tables are covered with vomit<br/>and there is not a spot without filth.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>“Who is it he is trying to teach?<br/>To whom is he explaining his message?<br/>To children weaned from their milk,<br/>to those just taken from the breast?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>For it is:<br/>Do and do, do and do,<br/>rule on rule, rule on rule;<br/>a little here, a little there.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>11</b>Very well then, with foreign lips and strange tongues<br/>God will speak to this people,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>to whom he said,<br/>“This is the resting place, let the weary rest”;<br/>and, “This is the place of repose”—<br/>but they would not listen.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>So then, the word of the Lord to them will become:<br/>Do and do, do and do,<br/>rule on rule, rule on rule;<br/>a little here, a little there—<br/>so that they will go and fall backward,<br/>be injured and snared and captured.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>14</b>Therefore hear the word of the Lord, you scoffers<br/>who rule this people in Jerusalem.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>You boast, “We have entered into a covenant with death,<br/>with the grave we have made an agreement.<br/>When an overwhelming scourge sweeps by,<br/>it cannot touch us,<br/>for we have made a lie our refuge<br/>and falsehood our hiding place.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>So this is what the Sovereign Lord says:<br/>“See, I lay a stone in Zion,<br/>a tested stone,<br/>a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation;<br/>the one who trusts will never be dismayed.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>I will make justice the measuring line<br/>and righteousness the plumb line;<br/>hail will sweep away your refuge, the lie,<br/>and water will overflow your hiding place.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>Your covenant with death will be annulled;<br/>your agreement with the grave will not stand.<br/>When the overwhelming scourge sweeps by,<br/>you will be beaten down by it.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>As often as it comes it will carry you away;<br/>morning after morning, by day and by night,<br/>it will sweep through.”<br/><br/>The understanding of this message<br/>will bring sheer terror.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>20</b>The bed is too short to stretch out on,<br/>the blanket too narrow to wrap around you.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>21</b>The Lord will rise up as he did at Mount Perazim,<br/>he will rouse himself as in the Valley of Gibeon—<br/>to do his work, his strange work,<br/>and perform his task, his alien task.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>22</b>Now stop your mocking,<br/>or your chains will become heavier;<br/>the Lord, the Lord Almighty, has told me<br/>of the destruction decreed against the whole land.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>23</b>Listen and hear my voice;<br/>pay attention and hear what I say.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>24</b>When a farmer plows for planting, does he plow continually?<br/>Does he keep on breaking up and harrowing the soil?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>25</b>When he has leveled the surface,<br/>does he not sow caraway and scatter cummin?<br/>Does he not plant wheat in its place,<br/>barley in its plot,<br/>and spelt in its field?</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>26</b>His God instructs him<br/>and teaches him the right way.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>27</b>Caraway is not threshed with a sledge,<br/>nor is a cartwheel rolled over cummin;<br/>caraway is beaten out with a rod,<br/>and cummin with a stick.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>28</b>Grain must be ground to make bread;<br/>so one does not go on threshing it forever.<br/>Though he drives the wheels of his threshing cart over it,<br/>his horses do not grind it.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>29</b>All this also comes from the Lord Almighty,<br/>wonderful in counsel and magnificent in wisdom.</span></p>

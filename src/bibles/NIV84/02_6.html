<h1>Exodus 6</h1><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Then the Lord said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh: Because of my mighty hand he will let them go; because of my mighty hand he will drive them out of his country.”</span><span><b>2</b>God also said to Moses, “I am the Lord.</span><span><b>3</b>I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name the Lord I did not make myself known to them.</span><span><b>4</b>I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, where they lived as aliens.</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered my covenant.</span><span><b>6</b>“Therefore, say to the Israelites: ‘I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. I will free you from being slaves to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment.</span><span><b>7</b>I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.</span></p><p><span><b>8</b>And I will bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the Lord.’ ”</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>Moses reported this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and cruel bondage.</span><span><b>10</b>Then the Lord said to Moses,</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>“Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country.”</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>But Moses said to the Lord, “If the Israelites will not listen to me, why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I speak with faltering lips?”</span></p><h2>Family Record of Moses and Aaron</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>Now the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron about the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he commanded them to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>These were the heads of their families:<br/><br/>The sons of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel were Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi.

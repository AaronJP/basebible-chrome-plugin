<h1>Deuteronomy 33</h1><h2>Moses Blesses the Tribes</h2><p><span><b>1</b>This is the blessing that Moses the man of God pronounced on the Israelites before his death.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>He said:<br/>“The Lord came from Sinai<br/>and dawned over them from Seir;<br/>he shone forth from Mount Paran.<br/>He came with myriads of holy ones<br/>from the south, from his mountain slopes.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>Surely it is you who love the people;<br/>all the holy ones are in your hand.<br/>At your feet they all bow down,<br/>and from you receive instruction,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>4</b>the law that Moses gave us,<br/>the possession of the assembly of Jacob.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>He was king over Jeshurun<br/>when the leaders of the people assembled,<br/>along with the tribes of Israel.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>6</b>“Let Reuben live and not die,<br/>nor his men be few.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>And this he said about Judah:<br/>“Hear, O Lord, the cry of Judah;<br/>bring him to his people.<br/>With his own hands he defends his cause.<br/>Oh, be his help against his foes!”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>About Levi he said:<br/>“Your Thummim and Urim belong<br/>to the man you favored.<br/>You tested him at Massah;<br/>you contended with him at the waters of Meribah.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>He said of his father and mother,<br/>‘I have no regard for them.’<br/>He did not recognize his brothers<br/>or acknowledge his own children,<br/>but he watched over your word<br/>and guarded your covenant.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>He teaches your precepts to Jacob<br/>and your law to Israel.<br/>He offers incense before you<br/>and whole burnt offerings on your altar.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>Bless all his skills, O Lord,<br/>and be pleased with the work of his hands.<br/>Smite the loins of those who rise up against him;<br/>strike his foes till they rise no more.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>About Benjamin he said:<br/>“Let the beloved of the Lord rest secure in him,<br/>for he shields him all day long,<br/>and the one the Lord loves rests between his shoulders.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>About Joseph he said:<br/>“May the Lord bless his land<br/>with the precious dew from heaven above<br/>and with the deep waters that lie below;</span></p><p/><p><span><b>14</b>with the best the sun brings forth<br/>and the finest the moon can yield;</span></p><p/><p><span><b>15</b>with the choicest gifts of the ancient mountains<br/>and the fruitfulness of the everlasting hills;</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>with the best gifts of the earth and its fullness<br/>and the favor of him who dwelt in the burning bush.<br/>Let all these rest on the head of Joseph,<br/>on the brow of the prince among his brothers.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>In majesty he is like a firstborn bull;<br/>his horns are the horns of a wild ox.<br/>With them he will gore the nations,<br/>even those at the ends of the earth.<br/>Such are the ten thousands of Ephraim;<br/>such are the thousands of Manasseh.”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>About Zebulun he said:<br/>“Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out,<br/>and you, Issachar, in your tents.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>They will summon peoples to the mountain<br/>and there offer sacrifices of righteousness;<br/>they will feast on the abundance of the seas,<br/>on the treasures hidden in the sand.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>About Gad he said:<br/>“Blessed is he who enlarges Gad's domain!<br/>Gad lives there like a lion,<br/>tearing at arm or head.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>21</b>He chose the best land for himself;<br/>the leader's portion was kept for him.<br/>When the heads of the people assembled,<br/>he carried out the Lord's righteous will,<br/>and his judgments concerning Israel.”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>22</b>About Dan he said:<br/>“Dan is a lion's cub,<br/>springing out of Bashan.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>23</b>About Naphtali he said:<br/>“Naphtali is abounding with the favor of the Lord<br/>and is full of his blessing;<br/>he will inherit southward to the lake.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>24</b>About Asher he said:<br/>“Most blessed of sons is Asher;<br/>let him be favored by his brothers,<br/>and let him bathe his feet in oil.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>25</b>The bolts of your gates will be iron and bronze,<br/>and your strength will equal your days.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>26</b>“There is no one like the God of Jeshurun,<br/>who rides on the heavens to help you<br/>and on the clouds in his majesty.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>27</b>The eternal God is your refuge,<br/>and underneath are the everlasting arms.<br/>He will drive out your enemy before you,<br/>saying, ‘Destroy him!’</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>28</b>So Israel will live in safety alone;<br/>Jacob's spring is secure<br/>in a land of grain and new wine,<br/>where the heavens drop dew.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>29</b>Blessed are you, O Israel!<br/>Who is like you,<br/>a people saved by the Lord?<br/>He is your shield and helper<br/>and your glorious sword.<br/>Your enemies will cower before you,<br/>and you will trample down their high places.”</span></p>

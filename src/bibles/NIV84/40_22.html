<h1>Matthew 22</h1><h2>The Parable of the Wedding Banquet</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:</span><span><b>2</b>“The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.</span></p><p><span><b>3</b>He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come.</span></p><p><span><b>4</b>“Then he sent some more servants and said, ‘Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.’</span><span><b>5</b>“But they paid no attention and went off–one to his field, another to his business.</span><span><b>6</b>The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</span><span><b>8</b>“Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come.</span><span><b>9</b>Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.’</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.</span><span><b>11</b>“But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>‘Friend,’ he asked, ‘how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ The man was speechless.</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>“Then the king told the attendants, ‘Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>“For many are invited, but few are chosen.”</span></p><h2>Paying Taxes to Caesar</h2><p><span><b>15</b>Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words.</span><span><b>16</b>They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. “Teacher,” they said, “we know you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are.</span></p><p><span><b>17</b>Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”</span><span><b>18</b>But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, “You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?</span><span><b>19</b>Show me the coin used for paying the tax.” They brought him a denarius,</span></p><p><span><b>20</b>and he asked them, “Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>21</b>“Caesar's,” they replied.<br/>Then he said to them, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's.”</span></p><p><span><b>22</b>When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away.</span></p><h2>Marriage at the Resurrection</h2><p><span><b>23</b>That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.</span><span><b>24</b>“Teacher,” they said, “Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and have children for him.</span><span><b>25</b>Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.</span><span><b>26</b>The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the seventh.</span><span><b>27</b>Finally, the woman died.</span></p><p><span><b>28</b>Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?”</span><span><b>29</b>Jesus replied, “You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.</span><span><b>30</b>At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.</span><span><b>31</b>But about the resurrection of the dead–have you not read what God said to you,</span></p><p><span><b>32</b>‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.”</span></p><p><span><b>33</b>When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.</span></p><h2>The Greatest Commandment</h2><p><span><b>34</b>Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together.</span></p><p><span><b>35</b>One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question:</span><span><b>36</b>“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”</span><span><b>37</b>Jesus replied: “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’</span><span><b>38</b>This is the first and greatest commandment.</span><span><b>39</b>And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’</span></p><p><span><b>40</b>All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”</span></p><h2>Whose Son Is the Christ</h2><p><span><b>41</b>While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>42</b>“What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?”<br/>“The son of David,” they replied.</span></p><p><span><b>43</b>He said to them, “How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him ‘Lord’? For he says,</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>44</b>” ‘The Lord said to my Lord:<br/>“Sit at my right hand<br/>until I put your enemies<br/>under your feet.” ’</span><span><b>45</b>If then David calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be his son?”</span></p><p><span><b>46</b>No one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions.</span></p>

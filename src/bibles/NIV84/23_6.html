<h1>Isaiah 6</h1><h2>Isaiah's Commission</h2><p><span><b>1</b>In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted, and the train of his robe filled the temple.</span><span><b>2</b>Above him were seraphs, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>And they were calling to one another:<br/>“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty;<br/>the whole earth is full of his glory.”</span></p><p><span><b>4</b>At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke.</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>“Woe to me!” I cried. “I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the Lord Almighty.”</span><span><b>6</b>Then one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>With it he touched my mouth and said, “See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>8</b>Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?”<br/>And I said, “Here am I. Send me!”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>He said, “Go and tell this people:<br/>“ ‘Be ever hearing, but never understanding;<br/>be ever seeing, but never perceiving.’</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>Make the heart of this people calloused;<br/>make their ears dull<br/>and close their eyes.<br/>Otherwise they might see with their eyes,<br/>hear with their ears,<br/>understand with their hearts,<br/>and turn and be healed.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>Then I said, “For how long, O Lord?”<br/>And he answered:<br/>“Until the cities lie ruined<br/>and without inhabitant,<br/>until the houses are left deserted<br/>and the fields ruined and ravaged,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>12</b>until the Lord has sent everyone far away<br/>and the land is utterly forsaken.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>And though a tenth remains in the land,<br/>it will again be laid waste.<br/>But as the terebinth and oak<br/>leave stumps when they are cut down,<br/>so the holy seed will be the stump in the land.”</span></p>

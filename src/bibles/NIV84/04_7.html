<h1>Numbers 7</h1><h2>Offerings at the Dedication of the Tabernacle</h2><p><span><b>1</b>When Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed it and consecrated it and all its furnishings. He also anointed and consecrated the altar and all its utensils.</span><span><b>2</b>Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of families who were the tribal leaders in charge of those who were counted, made offerings.</span></p><p><span><b>3</b>They brought as their gifts before the Lord six covered carts and twelve oxen—an ox from each leader and a cart from every two. These they presented before the tabernacle.</span><span><b>4</b>The Lord said to Moses,</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>“Accept these from them, that they may be used in the work at the Tent of Meeting. Give them to the Levites as each man's work requires.”</span><span><b>6</b>So Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the Levites.</span><span><b>7</b>He gave two carts and four oxen to the Gershonites, as their work required,</span><span><b>8</b>and he gave four carts and eight oxen to the Merarites, as their work required. They were all under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest.</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>But Moses did not give any to the Kohathites, because they were to carry on their shoulders the holy things, for which they were responsible.</span><span><b>10</b>When the altar was anointed, the leaders brought their offerings for its dedication and presented them before the altar.</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>For the Lord had said to Moses, “Each day one leader is to bring his offering for the dedication of the altar.”</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>The one who brought his offering on the first day was Nahshon son of Amminadab of the tribe of Judah.</span><span><b>13</b>His offering was one silver plate weighing a hundred and thirty shekels, and one silver sprinkling bowl weighing seventy shekels, both according to the sanctuary shekel, each filled with fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering;</span><span><b>14</b>one gold dish weighing ten shekels, filled with incense;</span><span><b>15</b>one young bull, one ram and one male lamb a year old, for a burnt offering;</span><span><b>16</b>one male goat for a sin offering;</span></p><p><span><b>17</b>and two oxen, five rams, five male goats and five male lambs a year old, to be sacrificed as a fellowship offering.

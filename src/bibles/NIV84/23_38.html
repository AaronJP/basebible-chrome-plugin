<h1>Isaiah 38</h1><h2>Hezekiah's Illness</h2><p/><p><span><b>1</b>In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said, “This is what the Lord says: Put your house in order, because you are going to die; you will not recover.”</span><span><b>2</b>Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord,</span></p><p><span><b>3</b>“Remember, O Lord, how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.</span><span><b>4</b>Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah:</span><span><b>5</b>“Go and tell Hezekiah, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will add fifteen years to your life.</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city.</span><span><b>7</b>“ ‘This is the Lord's sign to you that the Lord will do what he has promised:</span></p><p/><p><span><b>8</b>I will make the shadow cast by the sun go back the ten steps it has gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.’ ” So the sunlight went back the ten steps it had gone down.</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery:</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>I said, “In the prime of my life<br/>must I go through the gates of death<br/>and be robbed of the rest of my years?”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>I said, “I will not again see the Lord,<br/>the Lord, in the land of the living;<br/>no longer will I look on mankind,<br/>or be with those who now dwell in this world.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>Like a shepherd's tent my house<br/>has been pulled down and taken from me.<br/>Like a weaver I have rolled up my life,<br/>and he has cut me off from the loom;<br/>day and night you made an end of me.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>I waited patiently till dawn,<br/>but like a lion he broke all my bones;<br/>day and night you made an end of me.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>I cried like a swift or thrush,<br/>I moaned like a mourning dove.<br/>My eyes grew weak as I looked to the heavens.<br/>I am troubled; O Lord, come to my aid!”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>But what can I say?<br/>He has spoken to me, and he himself has done this.<br/>I will walk humbly all my years<br/>because of this anguish of my soul.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>Lord, by such things men live;<br/>and my spirit finds life in them too.<br/>You restored me to health<br/>and let me live.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>Surely it was for my benefit<br/>that I suffered such anguish.<br/>In your love you kept me<br/>from the pit of destruction;<br/>you have put all my sins<br/>behind your back.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>For the grave cannot praise you,<br/>death cannot sing your praise;<br/>those who go down to the pit<br/>cannot hope for your faithfulness.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>The living, the living—they praise you,<br/>as I am doing today;<br/>fathers tell their children<br/>about your faithfulness.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>The Lord will save me,<br/>and we will sing with stringed instruments<br/>all the days of our lives<br/>in the temple of the Lord.</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>Isaiah had said, “Prepare a poultice of figs and apply it to the boil, and he will recover.”</span></p><p><span><b>22</b>Hezekiah had asked, “What will be the sign that I will go up to the temple of the Lord?”</span></p>

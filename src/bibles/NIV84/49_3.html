<h1>Ephesians 3</h1><h2>Paul the Preacher to the Gentiles</h2><p/><p><span><b>1</b>For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles–</span><span><b>2</b>Surely you have heard about the administration of God's grace that was given to me for you,</span><span><b>3</b>that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly.</span><span><b>4</b>In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,</span><span><b>5</b>which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets.</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.</span><span><b>7</b>I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given me through the working of his power.</span><span><b>8</b>Although I am less than the least of all God's people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,</span><span><b>9</b>and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things.</span><span><b>10</b>His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,</span><span><b>11</b>according to his eternal purpose which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span><span><b>12</b>In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence.</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.</span></p><h2>A Prayer for the Ephesians</h2><p><span><b>14</b>For this reason I kneel before the Father,</span><span><b>15</b>from whom his whole family in heaven and on earth derives its name.</span><span><b>16</b>I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being,</span><span><b>17</b>so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,</span><span><b>18</b>may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ,</span></p><p><span><b>19</b>and to know this love that surpasses knowledge–that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.</span><span><b>20</b>Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us,</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.</span></p>

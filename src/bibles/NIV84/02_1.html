<h1>Exodus 1</h1><h2>The Israelites Oppressed</h2><p><span><b>1</b>These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:</span><span><b>2</b>Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;</span><span><b>3</b>Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;</span><span><b>4</b>Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy in all; Joseph was already in Egypt.</span><span><b>6</b>Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>but the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them.</span><span><b>8</b>Then a new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt.</span><span><b>9</b>“Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become much too numerous for us.</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.”</span><span><b>11</b>So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.</span><span><b>12</b>But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites</span><span><b>13</b>and worked them ruthlessly.</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>They made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their hard labor the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.</span><span><b>15</b>The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,</span><span><b>16</b>“When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live.”</span><span><b>17</b>The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live.</span></p><p><span><b>18</b>Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?”</span></p><p><span><b>19</b>The midwives answered Pharaoh, “Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.”</span><span><b>20</b>So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous.</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.</span></p><p><span><b>22</b>Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Every boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live.”</span></p>

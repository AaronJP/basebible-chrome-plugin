<h1>Ecclesiastes 4</h1><h2>Oppression, Toil, Friendlessness</h2><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Again I looked and saw all the oppression that was taking place under the sun:<br/>I saw the tears of the oppressed—<br/>and they have no comforter;<br/>power was on the side of their oppressors—<br/>and they have no comforter.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>And I declared that the dead,<br/>who had already died,<br/>are happier than the living,<br/>who are still alive.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>But better than both<br/>is he who has not yet been,<br/>who has not seen the evil<br/>that is done under the sun.</span></p><p><span><b>4</b>And I saw that all labor and all achievement spring from man's envy of his neighbor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>The fool folds his hands<br/>and ruins himself.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>Better one handful with tranquillity<br/>than two handfuls with toil<br/>and chasing after the wind.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>Again I saw something meaningless under the sun:</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>There was a man all alone;<br/>he had neither son nor brother.<br/>There was no end to his toil,<br/>yet his eyes were not content with his wealth.<br/>“For whom am I toiling,” he asked,<br/>“and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?”<br/>This too is meaningless—<br/>a miserable business!</span></p><p/><p><span><b>9</b>Two are better than one,<br/>because they have a good return for their work:</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>If one falls down,<br/>his friend can help him up.<br/>But pity the man who falls<br/>and has no one to help him up!</span></p><p/><p><span><b>11</b>Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm.<br/>But how can one keep warm alone?</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>Though one may be overpowered,<br/>two can defend themselves.<br/>A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.</span></p><h2>Advancement Is Meaningless</h2><p><span><b>13</b>Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to take warning.</span><span><b>14</b>The youth may have come from prison to the kingship, or he may have been born in poverty within his kingdom.</span><span><b>15</b>I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed the youth, the king's successor.</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>There was no end to all the people who were before them. But those who came later were not pleased with the successor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</span></p>

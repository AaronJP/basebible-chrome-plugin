<h1>Ecclesiastes 7</h1><h2>Wisdom</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>A good name is better than fine perfume,<br/>and the day of death better than the day of birth.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>It is better to go to a house of mourning<br/>than to go to a house of feasting,<br/>for death is the destiny of every man;<br/>the living should take this to heart.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>Sorrow is better than laughter,<br/>because a sad face is good for the heart.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>4</b>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,<br/>but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>It is better to heed a wise man's rebuke<br/>than to listen to the song of fools.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>Like the crackling of thorns under the pot,<br/>so is the laughter of fools.<br/>This too is meaningless.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>Extortion turns a wise man into a fool,<br/>and a bribe corrupts the heart.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>8</b>The end of a matter is better than its beginning,<br/>and patience is better than pride.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit,<br/>for anger resides in the lap of fools.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these?”<br/>For it is not wise to ask such questions.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>11</b>Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing<br/>and benefits those who see the sun.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>Wisdom is a shelter<br/>as money is a shelter,<br/>but the advantage of knowledge is this:<br/>that wisdom preserves the life of its possessor.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>Consider what God has done:<br/>Who can straighten<br/>what he has made crooked?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>When times are good, be happy;<br/>but when times are bad, consider:<br/>God has made the one<br/>as well as the other.<br/>Therefore, a man cannot discover<br/>anything about his future.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>In this meaningless life of mine I have seen both of these:<br/>a righteous man perishing in his righteousness,<br/>and a wicked man living long in his wickedness.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>Do not be overrighteous,<br/>neither be overwise—<br/>why destroy yourself?</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>Do not be overwicked,<br/>and do not be a fool—<br/>why die before your time?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>It is good to grasp the one<br/>and not let go of the other.<br/>The man who fears God will avoid all<i> extremes</i>.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>Wisdom makes one wise man more powerful<br/>than ten rulers in a city.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>There is not a righteous man on earth<br/>who does what is right and never sins.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>21</b>Do not pay attention to every word people say,<br/>or you may hear your servant cursing you—</span></p><p/><p><span><b>22</b>for you know in your heart<br/>that many times you yourself have cursed others.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>23</b>All this I tested by wisdom and I said,<br/>“I am determined to be wise”—<br/>but this was beyond me.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>24</b>Whatever wisdom may be,<br/>it is far off and most profound—<br/>who can discover it?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>25</b>So I turned my mind to understand,<br/>to investigate and to search out wisdom and the scheme of things<br/>and to understand the stupidity of wickedness<br/>and the madness of folly.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>26</b>I find more bitter than death<br/>the woman who is a snare,<br/>whose heart is a trap<br/>and whose hands are chains.<br/>The man who pleases God will escape her,<br/>but the sinner she will ensnare.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>27</b>“Look,” says the Teacher, “this is what I have discovered:<br/>“Adding one thing to another to discover the scheme of things—</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>28</b>while I was still searching<br/>but not finding—<br/>I found one<i> upright</i>man among a thousand,<br/>but not one<i> upright</i>woman among them all.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>29</b>This only have I found:<br/>God made mankind upright,<br/>but men have gone in search of many schemes.”</span></p>

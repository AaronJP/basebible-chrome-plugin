<h1>Isaiah 49</h1><h2>The Servant of the Lord</h2><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Listen to me, you islands;<br/>hear this, you distant nations:<br/>Before I was born the Lord called me;<br/>from my birth he has made mention of my name.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>He made my mouth like a sharpened sword,<br/>in the shadow of his hand he hid me;<br/>he made me into a polished arrow<br/>and concealed me in his quiver.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>He said to me, “You are my servant,<br/>Israel, in whom I will display my splendor.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>But I said, “I have labored to no purpose;<br/>I have spent my strength in vain and for nothing.<br/>Yet what is due me is in the Lord's hand,<br/>and my reward is with my God.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>And now the Lord says—<br/>he who formed me in the womb to be his servant<br/>to bring Jacob back to him<br/>and gather Israel to himself,<br/>for I am honored in the eyes of the Lord<br/>and my God has been my strength—</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>he says:<br/>“It is too small a thing for you to be my servant<br/>to restore the tribes of Jacob<br/>and bring back those of Israel I have kept.<br/>I will also make you a light for the Gentiles,<br/>that you may bring my salvation to the ends of the earth.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>This is what the Lord says—<br/>the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel—<br/>to him who was despised and abhorred by the nation,<br/>to the servant of rulers:<br/>“Kings will see you and rise up,<br/>princes will see and bow down,<br/>because of the Lord, who is faithful,<br/>the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”</span></p><h2>Restoration of Israel</h2><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>This is what the Lord says:<br/>“In the time of my favor I will answer you,<br/>and in the day of salvation I will help you;<br/>I will keep you and will make you<br/>to be a covenant for the people,<br/>to restore the land<br/>and to reassign its desolate inheritances,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>to say to the captives, ‘Come out,’<br/>and to those in darkness, ‘Be free!’<br/><br/>“They will feed beside the roads<br/>and find pasture on every barren hill.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>They will neither hunger nor thirst,<br/>nor will the desert heat or the sun beat upon them.<br/>He who has compassion on them will guide them<br/>and lead them beside springs of water.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>11</b>I will turn all my mountains into roads,<br/>and my highways will be raised up.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>See, they will come from afar—<br/>some from the north, some from the west,<br/>some from the region of Aswan.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>Shout for joy, O heavens;<br/>rejoice, O earth;<br/>burst into song, O mountains!<br/>For the Lord comforts his people<br/>and will have compassion on his afflicted ones.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>But Zion said, “The Lord has forsaken me,<br/>the Lord has forgotten me.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>“Can a mother forget the baby at her breast<br/>and have no compassion on the child she has borne?<br/>Though she may forget,<br/>I will not forget you!</span></p><p/><p><span><b>16</b>See, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands;<br/>your walls are ever before me.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>17</b>Your sons hasten back,<br/>and those who laid you waste depart from you.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>Lift up your eyes and look around;<br/>all your sons gather and come to you.<br/>As surely as I live,” declares the Lord,<br/>“you will wear them all as ornaments;<br/>you will put them on, like a bride.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>“Though you were ruined and made desolate<br/>and your land laid waste,<br/>now you will be too small for your people,<br/>and those who devoured you will be far away.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>The children born during your bereavement<br/>will yet say in your hearing,<br/>‘This place is too small for us;<br/>give us more space to live in.’</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>21</b>Then you will say in your heart,<br/>‘Who bore me these?<br/>I was bereaved and barren;<br/>I was exiled and rejected.<br/>Who brought these up?<br/>I was left all alone,<br/>but these—where have they come from?’ ”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>22</b>This is what the Sovereign Lord says:<br/>“See, I will beckon to the Gentiles,<br/>I will lift up my banner to the peoples;<br/>they will bring your sons in their arms<br/>and carry your daughters on their shoulders.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>23</b>Kings will be your foster fathers,<br/>and their queens your nursing mothers.<br/>They will bow down before you with their faces to the ground;<br/>they will lick the dust at your feet.<br/>Then you will know that I am the Lord;<br/>those who hope in me will not be disappointed.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>24</b>Can plunder be taken from warriors,<br/>or captives rescued from the fierce?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>25</b>But this is what the Lord says:<br/>“Yes, captives will be taken from warriors,<br/>and plunder retrieved from the fierce;<br/>I will contend with those who contend with you,<br/>and your children I will save.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>26</b>I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh;<br/>they will be drunk on their own blood, as with wine.<br/>Then all mankind will know<br/>that I, the Lord, am your Savior,<br/>your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”</span></p>

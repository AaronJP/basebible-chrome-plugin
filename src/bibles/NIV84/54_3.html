<h1>1 Timothy 3</h1><h2>Overseers and Deacons</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Here is a trustworthy saying: If anyone sets his heart on being an overseer, he desires a noble task.</span><span><b>2</b>Now the overseer must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate, selfâ€‘controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,</span><span><b>3</b>not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.</span><span><b>4</b>He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him with proper respect.</span><span><b>5</b>(If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church?)</span><span><b>6</b>He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil's trap.</span><span><b>8</b>Deacons, likewise, are to be men worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain.</span><span><b>9</b>They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience.</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons.</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>In the same way, their wives are to be women worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything.</span><span><b>12</b>A deacon must be the husband of but one wife and must manage his children and his household well.</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.</span><span><b>14</b>Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so that,</span><span><b>15</b>if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>Beyond all question, the mystery of godliness is great:<br/>He appeared in a body,<br/>was vindicated by the Spirit,<br/>was seen by angels,<br/>was preached among the nations,<br/>was believed on in the world,<br/>was taken up in glory.</span></p>

<h1>1 Timothy 2</h1><h2>Instructions on Worship</h2><p><span><b>1</b>I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone–</span><span><b>2</b>for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.</span><span><b>3</b>This is good, and pleases God our Savior,</span><span><b>4</b>who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.</span><span><b>5</b>For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,</span><span><b>6</b>who gave himself as a ransom for all men–the testimony given in its proper time.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle–I am telling the truth, I am not lying–and a teacher of the true faith to the Gentiles.</span></p><p><span><b>8</b>I want men everywhere to lift up holy hands in prayer, without anger or disputing.</span><span><b>9</b>I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.</span><span><b>11</b>A woman should learn in quietness and full submission.</span><span><b>12</b>I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent.</span><span><b>13</b>For Adam was formed first, then Eve.</span><span><b>14</b>And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.</span></p><p><span><b>15</b>But women will be saved through childbearing–if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety.</span></p>

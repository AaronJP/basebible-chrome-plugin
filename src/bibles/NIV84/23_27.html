<h1>Isaiah 27</h1><h2>Deliverance of Israel</h2><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>In that day,<br/>the Lord will punish with his sword,<br/>his fierce, great and powerful sword,<br/>Leviathan the gliding serpent,<br/>Leviathan the coiling serpent;<br/>he will slay the monster of the sea.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>2</b>In that day—<br/>“Sing about a fruitful vineyard:</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>I, the Lord, watch over it;<br/>I water it continually.<br/>I guard it day and night<br/>so that no one may harm it.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>I am not angry.<br/>If only there were briers and thorns confronting me!<br/>I would march against them in battle;<br/>I would set them all on fire.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>Or else let them come to me for refuge;<br/>let them make peace with me,<br/>yes, let them make peace with me.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>In days to come Jacob will take root,<br/>Israel will bud and blossom<br/>and fill all the world with fruit.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>Has<i> the</i><i> Lord</i>struck her<br/>as he struck down those who struck her?<br/>Has she been killed<br/>as those were killed who killed her?</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>By warfare and exile you contend with her—<br/>with his fierce blast he drives her out,<br/>as on a day the east wind blows.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>By this, then, will Jacob's guilt be atoned for,<br/>and this will be the full fruitage of the removal of his sin:<br/>When he makes all the altar stones<br/>to be like chalk stones crushed to pieces,<br/>no Asherah poles or incense altars<br/>will be left standing.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>The fortified city stands desolate,<br/>an abandoned settlement, forsaken like the desert;<br/>there the calves graze,<br/>there they lie down;<br/>they strip its branches bare.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>When its twigs are dry, they are broken off<br/>and women come and make fires with them.<br/>For this is a people without understanding;<br/>so their Maker has no compassion on them,<br/>and their Creator shows them no favor.</span><span><b>12</b>In that day the Lord will thresh from the flowing Euphratesto the Wadi of Egypt, and you, O Israelites, will be gathered up one by one.</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>And in that day a great trumpet will sound. Those who were perishing in Assyria and those who were exiled in Egypt will come and worship the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.</span></p>

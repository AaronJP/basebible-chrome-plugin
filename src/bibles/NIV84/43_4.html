<h1>John 4</h1><h2>Jesus Talks With a Samaritan Woman</h2><p><span><b>1</b>The Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John,</span><span><b>2</b>although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples.</span></p><p><span><b>3</b>When the Lord learned of this, he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee.</span><span><b>4</b>Now he had to go through Samaria.</span><span><b>5</b>So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph.</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</span><span><b>7</b>When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, “Will you give me a drink?”</span></p><p><span><b>8</b>(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>The Samaritan woman said to him, “You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.)</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.”</span><span><b>11</b>“Sir,” the woman said, “you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water?</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his flocks and herds?”</span><span><b>13</b>Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.”</span></p><p><span><b>15</b>The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.”</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>He told her, “Go, call your husband and come back.”</span></p><p><span><b>17</b>“I have no husband,” she replied.<br/>Jesus said to her, “You are right when you say you have no husband.</span></p><p><span><b>18</b>The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.”</span><span><b>19</b>“Sir,” the woman said, “I can see that you are a prophet.</span></p><p><span><b>20</b>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.”</span><span><b>21</b>Jesus declared, “Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.</span><span><b>22</b>You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.</span><span><b>23</b>Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.</span></p><p><span><b>24</b>God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.”</span></p><p><span><b>25</b>The woman said, “I know that Messiah” (called Christ) “is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.”</span></p><p><span><b>26</b>Then Jesus declared, “I who speak to you am he.”</span></p><h2>The Disciples Rejoin Jesus</h2><p/><p><span><b>27</b>Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?”</span><span><b>28</b>Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people,</span><span><b>29</b>“Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?”</span></p><p><span><b>30</b>They came out of the town and made their way toward him.</span></p><p><span><b>31</b>Meanwhile his disciples urged him, “Rabbi, eat something.”</span></p><p><span><b>32</b>But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.”</span></p><p><span><b>33</b>Then his disciples said to each other, “Could someone have brought him food?”</span><span><b>34</b>“My food,” said Jesus, “is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.</span><span><b>35</b>Do you not say, ‘Four months more and then the harvest’? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.</span><span><b>36</b>Even now the reaper draws his wages, even now he harvests the crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together.</span><span><b>37</b>Thus the saying ‘One sows and another reaps’ is true.</span></p><p><span><b>38</b>I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.”</span></p><h2>Many Samaritans Believe</h2><p><span><b>39</b>Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, “He told me everything I ever did.”</span><span><b>40</b>So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days.</span></p><p><span><b>41</b>And because of his words many more became believers.</span></p><p><span><b>42</b>They said to the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.”</span></p><h2>Jesus Heals the Official's Son</h2><p><span><b>43</b>After the two days he left for Galilee.</span><span><b>44</b>(Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.)</span></p><p><span><b>45</b>When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, for they also had been there.</span><span><b>46</b>Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.</span></p><p><span><b>47</b>When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.</span></p><p><span><b>48</b>“Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders,” Jesus told him, “you will never believe.”</span></p><p><span><b>49</b>The royal official said, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”</span></p><p><span><b>50</b>Jesus replied, “You may go. Your son will live.”<br/>The man took Jesus at his word and departed.</span><span><b>51</b>While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living.</span></p><p><span><b>52</b>When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, “The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.”</span></p><p><span><b>53</b>Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, “Your son will live.” So he and all his household believed.</span></p><p><span><b>54</b>This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed, having come from Judea to Galilee.</span></p>

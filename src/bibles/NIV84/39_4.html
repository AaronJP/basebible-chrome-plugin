<h1>Malachi 4</h1><h2>The Day of the Lord</h2><p><span><b>1</b>“Surely the day is coming; it will burn like a furnace. All the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble, and that day that is coming will set them on fire,” says the Lord Almighty. “Not a root or a branch will be left to them.</span><span><b>2</b>But for you who revere my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings. And you will go out and leap like calves released from the stall.</span></p><p><span><b>3</b>Then you will trample down the wicked; they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day when I do these things,” says the Lord Almighty.</span></p><p><span><b>4</b>“Remember the law of my servant Moses, the decrees and laws I gave him at Horeb for all Israel.</span><span><b>5</b>“See, I will send you the prophet Elijah before that great and dreadful day of the Lord comes.</span><span><b>6</b>He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers; or else I will come and strike the land with a curse.”</span></p>

<h1>2 Samuel 7</h1><h2>God's Promise to David</h2><p><span><b>1</b>After the king was settled in his palace and the Lord had given him rest from all his enemies around him,</span></p><p><span><b>2</b>he said to Nathan the prophet, “Here I am, living in a palace of cedar, while the ark of God remains in a tent.”</span></p><p><span><b>3</b>Nathan replied to the king, “Whatever you have in mind, go ahead and do it, for the Lord is with you.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>4</b>That night the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying:</span><span><b>5</b>“Go and tell my servant David, ‘This is what the Lord says: Are you the one to build me a house to dwell in?</span><span><b>6</b>I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought the Israelites up out of Egypt to this day. I have been moving from place to place with a tent as my dwelling.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their rulers whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, “Why have you not built me a house of cedar?” ’</span><span><b>8</b>“Now then, tell my servant David, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty says: I took you from the pasture and from following the flock to be ruler over my people Israel.</span><span><b>9</b>I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name great, like the names of the greatest men of the earth.</span><span><b>10</b>And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders over my people Israel. I will also give you rest from all your enemies.<br/>“ ‘The Lord declares to you that the Lord himself will establish a house for you:</span><span><b>12</b>When your days are over and you rest with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, who will come from your own body, and I will establish his kingdom.</span><span><b>13</b>He is the one who will build a house for my Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.</span><span><b>14</b>I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will punish him with the rod of men, with floggings inflicted by men.</span><span><b>15</b>But my love will never be taken away from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>16</b>Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me; your throne will be established forever.’ ”</span></p><p><span><b>17</b>Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation.</span></p><h2>David's Prayer</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>Then King David went in and sat before the Lord, and he said:<br/><br/>“Who am I, O Sovereign Lord, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?</span></p><p><span><b>19</b>And as if this were not enough in your sight, O Sovereign Lord, you have also spoken about the future of the house of your servant. Is this your usual way of dealing with man, O Sovereign Lord?</span><span><b>20</b>“What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, O Sovereign Lord.</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>For the sake of your word and according to your will, you have done this great thing and made it known to your servant.</span><span><b>22</b>“How great you are, O Sovereign Lord! There is no one like you, and there is no God but you, as we have heard with our own ears.</span><span><b>23</b>And who is like your people Israel—the one nation on earth that God went out to redeem as a people for himself, and to make a name for himself, and to perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations and their gods from before your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt?</span></p><p><span><b>24</b>You have established your people Israel as your very own forever, and you, O Lord, have become their God.</span><span><b>25</b>“And now, Lord God, keep forever the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house. Do as you promised,</span></p><p><span><b>26</b>so that your name will be great forever. Then men will say, ‘The Lord Almighty is God over Israel!’ And the house of your servant David will be established before you.</span><span><b>27</b>“O Lord Almighty, God of Israel, you have revealed this to your servant, saying, ‘I will build a house for you.’ So your servant has found courage to offer you this prayer.</span><span><b>28</b>O Sovereign Lord, you are God! Your words are trustworthy, and you have promised these good things to your servant.</span></p><p><span><b>29</b>Now be pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever in your sight; for you, O Sovereign Lord, have spoken, and with your blessing the house of your servant will be blessed forever.”</span></p>

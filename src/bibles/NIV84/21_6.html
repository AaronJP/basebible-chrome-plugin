<h1>Ecclesiastes 6</h1><p><span><b>1</b>I have seen another evil under the sun, and it weighs heavily on men:</span></p><p><span><b>2</b>God gives a man wealth, possessions and honor, so that he lacks nothing his heart desires, but God does not enable him to enjoy them, and a stranger enjoys them instead. This is meaningless, a grievous evil.</span><span><b>3</b>A man may have a hundred children and live many years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he cannot enjoy his prosperity and does not receive proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.</span><span><b>4</b>It comes without meaning, it departs in darkness, and in darkness its name is shrouded.</span><span><b>5</b>Though it never saw the sun or knew anything, it has more rest than does that manâ€”</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place?</span></p><p/><p><span><b>7</b>All man's efforts are for his mouth,<br/>yet his appetite is never satisfied.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>What advantage has a wise man<br/>over a fool?<br/>What does a poor man gain<br/>by knowing how to conduct himself before others?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>Better what the eye sees<br/>than the roving of the appetite.<br/>This too is meaningless,<br/>a chasing after the wind.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>Whatever exists has already been named,<br/>and what man is has been known;<br/>no man can contend<br/>with one who is stronger than he.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>The more the words,<br/>the less the meaning,<br/>and how does that profit anyone?</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>For who knows what is good for a man in life, during the few and meaningless days he passes through like a shadow? Who can tell him what will happen under the sun after he is gone?</span></p>

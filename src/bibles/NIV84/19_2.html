<h1>Psalm 2</h1><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Why do the nations conspire<br/>and the peoples plot in vain?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>The kings of the earth take their stand<br/>and the rulers gather together<br/>against the Lord<br/>and against his Anointed One.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>“Let us break their chains,” they say,<br/>“and throw off their fetters.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>4</b>The One enthroned in heaven laughs;<br/>the Lord scoffs at them.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>Then he rebukes them in his anger<br/>and terrifies them in his wrath, saying,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>6</b>“I have installed my King<br/>on Zion, my holy hill.”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>I will proclaim the decree of the Lord:<br/>He said to me, “You are my Son;<br/>today I have become your Father.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>Ask of me,<br/>and I will make the nations your inheritance,<br/>the ends of the earth your possession.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>You will rule them with an iron scepter;<br/>you will dash them to pieces like pottery.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>10</b>Therefore, you kings, be wise;<br/>be warned, you rulers of the earth.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>11</b>Serve the Lord with fear<br/>and rejoice with trembling.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>Kiss the Son, lest he be angry<br/>and you be destroyed in your way,<br/>for his wrath can flare up in a moment.<br/>Blessed are all who take refuge in him.</span></p>

<h1>Ezekiel 22</h1><h2>Jerusalem's Sins</h2><p><span><b>1</b>The word of the LORD came to me:</span><span><b>2</b>“Son of man, will you judge her? Will you judge this city of bloodshed? Then confront her with all her detestable practices</span><span><b>3</b>and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: O city that brings on herself doom by shedding blood in her midst and defiles herself by making idols,</span><span><b>4</b>you have become guilty because of the blood you have shed and have become defiled by the idols you have made. You have brought your days to a close, and the end of your years has come. Therefore I will make you an object of scorn to the nations and a laughingstock to all the countries.</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>Those who are near and those who are far away will mock you, O infamous city, full of turmoil.</span><span><b>6</b>” ‘See how each of the princes of Israel who are in you uses his power to shed blood.</span><span><b>7</b>In you they have treated father and mother with contempt; in you they have oppressed the alien and mistreated the fatherless and the widow.</span><span><b>8</b>You have despised my holy things and desecrated my Sabbaths.</span><span><b>9</b>In you are slanderous men bent on shedding blood; in you are those who eat at the mountain shrines and commit lewd acts.</span><span><b>10</b>In you are those who dishonor their fathers' bed; in you are those who violate women during their period, when they are ceremonially unclean.</span><span><b>11</b>In you one man commits a detestable offense with his neighbor's wife, another shamefully defiles his daughter-in-law, and another violates his sister, his own father's daughter.</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>In you men accept bribes to shed blood; you take usury and excessive interest and make unjust gain from your neighbors by extortion. And you have forgotten me, declares the Sovereign LORD.</span><span><b>13</b>” ‘I will surely strike my hands together at the unjust gain you have made and at the blood you have shed in your midst.</span><span><b>14</b>Will your courage endure or your hands be strong in the day I deal with you? I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it.</span><span><b>15</b>I will disperse you among the nations and scatter you through the countries; and I will put an end to your uncleanness.</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>When you have been defiled in the eyes of the nations, you will know that I am the LORD.’ ”</span><span><b>17</b>Then the word of the LORD came to me:</span><span><b>18</b>“Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me; all of them are the copper, tin, iron and lead left inside a furnace. They are but the dross of silver.</span><span><b>19</b>Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: ‘Because you have all become dross, I will gather you into Jerusalem.</span><span><b>20</b>As men gather silver, copper, iron, lead and tin into a furnace to melt it with a fiery blast, so will I gather you in my anger and my wrath and put you inside the city and melt you.</span><span><b>21</b>I will gather you and I will blow on you with my fiery wrath, and you will be melted inside her.</span></p><p><span><b>22</b>As silver is melted in a furnace, so you will be melted inside her, and you will know that I the LORD have poured out my wrath upon you.’ ”</span><span><b>23</b>Again the word of the LORD came to me:</span><span><b>24</b>“Son of man, say to the land, ‘You are a land that has had no rain or showers in the day of wrath.’</span><span><b>25</b>There is a conspiracy of her princes within her like a roaring lion tearing its prey; they devour people, take treasures and precious things and make many widows within her.</span><span><b>26</b>Her priests do violence to my law and profane my holy things; they do not distinguish between the holy and the common; they teach that there is no difference between the unclean and the clean; and they shut their eyes to the keeping of my Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them.</span><span><b>27</b>Her officials within her are like wolves tearing their prey; they shed blood and kill people to make unjust gain.</span><span><b>28</b>Her prophets whitewash these deeds for them by false visions and lying divinations. They say, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says’—when the LORD has not spoken.</span></p><p><span><b>29</b>The people of the land practice extortion and commit robbery; they oppress the poor and needy and mistreat the alien, denying them justice.</span><span><b>30</b>“I looked for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not have to destroy it, but I found none.</span></p><p><span><b>31</b>So I will pour out my wrath on them and consume them with my fiery anger, bringing down on their own heads all they have done, declares the Sovereign LORD.”</span></p>

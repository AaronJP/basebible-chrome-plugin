<h1>Psalm 40</h1><h2>For the director of music. Of David. A psalm.</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>I waited patiently for the Lord;<br/>he turned to me and heard my cry.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>He lifted me out of the slimy pit,<br/>out of the mud and mire;<br/>he set my feet on a rock<br/>and gave me a firm place to stand.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>He put a new song in my mouth,<br/>a hymn of praise to our God.<br/>Many will see and fear<br/>and put their trust in the Lord.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>Blessed is the man<br/>who makes the Lord his trust,<br/>who does not look to the proud,<br/>to those who turn aside to false gods.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>Many, O Lord my God,<br/>are the wonders you have done.<br/>The things you planned for us<br/>no one can recount to you;<br/>were I to speak and tell of them,<br/>they would be too many to declare.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>Sacrifice and offering you did not desire,<br/>but my ears you have pierced,;<br/>burnt offerings and sin offerings<br/>you did not require.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>7</b>Then I said, “Here I am, I have come—<br/>it is written about me in the scroll.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>I desire to do your will, O my God;<br/>your law is within my heart.”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>I proclaim righteousness in the great assembly;<br/>I do not seal my lips,<br/>as you know, O Lord.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>I do not hide your righteousness in my heart;<br/>I speak of your faithfulness and salvation.<br/>I do not conceal your love and your truth<br/>from the great assembly.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>11</b>Do not withhold your mercy from me, O Lord;<br/>may your love and your truth always protect me.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>For troubles without number surround me;<br/>my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see.<br/>They are more than the hairs of my head,<br/>and my heart fails within me.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>13</b>Be pleased, O Lord, to save me;<br/>O Lord, come quickly to help me.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>May all who seek to take my life<br/>be put to shame and confusion;<br/>may all who desire my ruin<br/>be turned back in disgrace.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>15</b>May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!”<br/>be appalled at their own shame.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>But may all who seek you<br/>rejoice and be glad in you;<br/>may those who love your salvation always say,<br/>“The Lord be exalted!”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>Yet I am poor and needy;<br/>may the Lord think of me.<br/>You are my help and my deliverer;<br/>O my God, do not delay.</span></p>

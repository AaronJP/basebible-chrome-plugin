<h1>Numbers 23</h1><h2>Balaam's First Oracle</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Balaam said, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”</span></p><p><span><b>2</b>Balak did as Balaam said, and the two of them offered a bull and a ram on each altar.</span></p><p><span><b>3</b>Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering while I go aside. Perhaps the Lord will come to meet with me. Whatever he reveals to me I will tell you.” Then he went off to a barren height.</span></p><p><span><b>4</b>God met with him, and Balaam said, “I have prepared seven altars, and on each altar I have offered a bull and a ram.”</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>The Lord put a message in Balaam's mouth and said, “Go back to Balak and give him this message.”</span><span><b>6</b>So he went back to him and found him standing beside his offering, with all the princes of Moab.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>Then Balaam uttered his oracle:<br/>“Balak brought me from Aram,<br/>the king of Moab from the eastern mountains.<br/>‘Come,’ he said, ‘curse Jacob for me;<br/>come, denounce Israel.’</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>How can I curse<br/>those whom God has not cursed?<br/>How can I denounce<br/>those whom the Lord has not denounced?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>From the rocky peaks I see them,<br/>from the heights I view them.<br/>I see a people who live apart<br/>and do not consider themselves one of the nations.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>Who can count the dust of Jacob<br/>or number the fourth part of Israel?<br/>Let me die the death of the righteous,<br/>and may my end be like theirs!”</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but you have done nothing but bless them!”</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>He answered, “Must I not speak what the Lord puts in my mouth?”</span></p><h2>Balaam's Second Oracle</h2><p><span><b>13</b>Then Balak said to him, “Come with me to another place where you can see them; you will see only a part but not all of them. And from there, curse them for me.”</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>So he took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah, and there he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.</span></p><p><span><b>15</b>Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering while I meet with him over there.”</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>The Lord met with Balaam and put a message in his mouth and said, “Go back to Balak and give him this message.”</span></p><p><span><b>17</b>So he went to him and found him standing beside his offering, with the princes of Moab. Balak asked him, “What did the Lord say?”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>Then he uttered his oracle:<br/>“Arise, Balak, and listen;<br/>hear me, son of Zippor.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>God is not a man, that he should lie,<br/>nor a son of man, that he should change his mind.<br/>Does he speak and then not act?<br/>Does he promise and not fulfill?</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>I have received a command to bless;<br/>he has blessed, and I cannot change it.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>21</b>“No misfortune is seen in Jacob,<br/>no misery observed in Israel.<br/>The Lord their God is with them;<br/>the shout of the King is among them.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>22</b>God brought them out of Egypt;<br/>they have the strength of a wild ox.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>23</b>There is no sorcery against Jacob,<br/>no divination against Israel.<br/>It will now be said of Jacob<br/>and of Israel, ‘See what God has done!’</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>24</b>The people rise like a lioness;<br/>they rouse themselves like a lion<br/>that does not rest till he devours his prey<br/>and drinks the blood of his victims.”</span></p><p><span><b>25</b>Then Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!”</span></p><p><span><b>26</b>Balaam answered, “Did I not tell you I must do whatever the Lord says?”</span></p><h2>Balaam's Third Oracle</h2><p><span><b>27</b>Then Balak said to Balaam, “Come, let me take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there.”</span></p><p><span><b>28</b>And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the wasteland.</span><span><b>29</b>Balaam said, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”</span></p><p><span><b>30</b>Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.</span></p>

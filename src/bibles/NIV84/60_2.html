<h1>1 Peter 2</h1><p><span><b>1</b>Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind.</span><span><b>2</b>Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,</span></p><p><span><b>3</b>now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.</span></p><h2>The Living Stone and a Chosen People</h2><p><span><b>4</b>As you come to him, the living Stone–rejected by men but chosen by God and precious to him–</span><span><b>5</b>you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>For in Scripture it says:<br/>“See, I lay a stone in Zion,<br/>a chosen and precious cornerstone,<br/>and the one who trusts in him<br/>will never be put to shame.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>7</b>Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe,<br/>“The stone the builders rejected<br/>has become the capstone,”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>and,<br/>“A stone that causes men to stumble<br/>and a rock that makes them fall.”They stumble because they disobey the message–which is also what they were destined for.</span><span><b>9</b>But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.</span><span><b>11</b>Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from sinful desires, which war against your soul.</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.</span></p><h2>Submission to Rulers and Masters</h2><p><span><b>13</b>Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority,</span><span><b>14</b>or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.</span><span><b>15</b>For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish men.</span><span><b>16</b>Live as free men, but do not use your freedom as a cover‑up for evil; live as servants of God.</span></p><p><span><b>17</b>Show proper respect to everyone: Love the brotherhood of believers, fear God, honor the king.</span><span><b>18</b>Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh.</span><span><b>19</b>For it is commendable if a man bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God.</span><span><b>20</b>But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God.</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps.</span></p><p><span><b>22</b>“He committed no sin,<br/>and no deceit was found in his mouth.”</span><span><b>23</b>When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.</span><span><b>24</b>He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed.</span></p><p><span><b>25</b>For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</span></p>

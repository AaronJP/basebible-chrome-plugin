A song.</h2><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>We give thanks to you, O God,<br/>we give thanks, for your Name is near;<br/>men tell of your wonderful deeds.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>2</b>You say, “I choose the appointed time;<br/>it is I who judge uprightly.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>When the earth and all its people quake,<br/>it is I who hold its pillars firm.<br/>Selah</span></p><p/><p><span><b>4</b>To the arrogant I say, ‘Boast no more,’<br/>and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horns.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>Do not lift your horns against heaven;<br/>do not speak with outstretched neck.’ ”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>6</b>No one from the east or the west<br/>or from the desert can exalt a man.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>7</b>But it is God who judges:<br/>He brings one down, he exalts another.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>In the hand of the Lord is a cup<br/>full of foaming wine mixed with spices;<br/>he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth<br/>drink it down to its very dregs.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>9</b>As for me, I will declare this forever;<br/>I will sing praise to the God of Jacob.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>10</b>I will cut off the horns of all the wicked,<br/>but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.</span></p>

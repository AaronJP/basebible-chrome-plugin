<h1>2 Corinthians 2</h1><p><span><b>1</b>So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you.</span><span><b>2</b>For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved?</span><span><b>3</b>I wrote as I did so that when I came I should not be distressed by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy.</span></p><p><span><b>4</b>For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you.</span></p><h2>Forgiveness for the Sinner</h2><p><span><b>5</b>If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you, to some extent–not to put it too severely.</span><span><b>6</b>The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient for him.</span><span><b>7</b>Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.</span><span><b>8</b>I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him.</span><span><b>9</b>The reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything.</span><span><b>10</b>If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And what I have forgiven–if there was anything to forgive–I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake,</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.</span></p><h2>Ministers of the New Covenant</h2><p><span><b>12</b>Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me,</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said good‑by to them and went on to Macedonia.</span><span><b>14</b>But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him.</span><span><b>15</b>For we are to God the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing.</span><span><b>16</b>To the one we are the smell of death; to the other, the fragrance of life. And who is equal to such a task?</span></p><p><span><b>17</b>Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, like men sent from God.</span></p>

<h1>2 Timothy 2</h1><p><span><b>1</b>You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</span><span><b>2</b>And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others.</span><span><b>3</b>Endure hardship with us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</span><span><b>4</b>No one serving as a soldier gets involved in civilian affairs–he wants to please his commanding officer.</span><span><b>5</b>Similarly, if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not receive the victor's crown unless he competes according to the rules.</span><span><b>6</b>The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this.</span><span><b>8</b>Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel,</span><span><b>9</b>for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God's word is not chained.</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>Here is a trustworthy saying:<br/>If we died with him,<br/>we will also live with him;</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>if we endure,<br/>we will also reign with him.<br/>If we disown him,<br/>he will also disown us;</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>if we are faithless,<br/>he will remain faithful,<br/>for he cannot disown himself.</span></p><h2>A Workman Approved by God</h2><p><span><b>14</b>Keep reminding them of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen.</span><span><b>15</b>Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.</span><span><b>16</b>Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly.</span><span><b>17</b>Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</span><span><b>18</b>who have wandered away from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some.</span></p><p><span><b>19</b>Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.”</span><span><b>20</b>In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for noble purposes and some for ignoble.</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>If a man cleanses himself from the latter, he will be an instrument for noble purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work.</span><span><b>22</b>Flee the evil desires of youth, and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</span><span><b>23</b>Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels.</span><span><b>24</b>And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.</span><span><b>25</b>Those who oppose him he must gently instruct, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth,</span></p><p><span><b>26</b>and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.</span></p>

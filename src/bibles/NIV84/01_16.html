<h1>Genesis 16</h1><h2>Hagar and Ishmael</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar;</span></p><p><span><b>2</b>so she said to Abram, “The Lord has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family through her.”<br/>Abram agreed to what Sarai said.</span><span><b>3</b>So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife.</span></p><p><span><b>4</b>He slept with Hagar, and she conceived.<br/>When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>Then Sarai said to Abram, “You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my servant in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the Lord judge between you and me.”</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>“Your servant is in your hands,” Abram said. “Do with her whatever you think best.” Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her.</span><span><b>7</b>The angel of the Lord found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>8</b>And he said, “Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?”<br/>“I'm running away from my mistress Sarai,” she answered.</span><span><b>9</b>Then the angel of the Lord told her, “Go back to your mistress and submit to her.”</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>The angel added, “I will so increase your descendants that they will be too numerous to count.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>The angel of the Lord also said to her:<br/>“You are now with child<br/>and you will have a son.<br/>You shall name him Ishmael,<br/>for the Lord has heard of your misery.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>He will be a wild donkey of a man;<br/>his hand will be against everyone<br/>and everyone's hand against him,<br/>and he will live in hostility<br/>toward all his brothers.”</span><span><b>13</b>She gave this name to the Lord who spoke to her: “You are the God who sees me,” for she said, “I have now seen the One who sees me.”</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered.</span><span><b>15</b>So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.</span></p>

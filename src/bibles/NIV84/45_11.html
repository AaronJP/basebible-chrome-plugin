<h1>Romans 11</h1><h2>The Remnant of Israel</h2><p><span><b>1</b>I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.</span><span><b>2</b>God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don't you know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah–how he appealed to God against Israel:</span><span><b>3</b>“Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me”?</span><span><b>4</b>And what was God's answer to him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”</span><span><b>5</b>So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace.</span><span><b>7</b>What then? What Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>as it is written:<br/>“God gave them a spirit of stupor,<br/>eyes so that they could not see<br/>and ears so that they could not hear,<br/>to this very day.”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>And David says:<br/>“May their table become a snare and a trap,<br/>a stumbling block and a retribution for them.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>10</b>May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see,<br/>and their backs be bent forever.”</span></p><h2>Ingrafted Branches</h2><p><span><b>11</b>Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious.</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring!</span><span><b>13</b>I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry</span><span><b>14</b>in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them.</span><span><b>15</b>For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches.</span><span><b>17</b>If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root,</span><span><b>18</b>do not boast over those branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you.</span><span><b>19</b>You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.”</span><span><b>20</b>Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid.</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.</span><span><b>22</b>Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off.</span><span><b>23</b>And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</span></p><p><span><b>24</b>After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!</span></p><h2>All Israel Will Be Saved</h2><p><span><b>25</b>I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>26</b>And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written:<br/>“The deliverer will come from Zion;<br/>he will turn godlessness away from Jacob.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>27</b>And this is my covenant with them<br/>when I take away their sins.”</span><span><b>28</b>As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies on your account; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs,</span><span><b>29</b>for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable.</span><span><b>30</b>Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience,</span><span><b>31</b>so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you.</span></p><p><span><b>32</b>For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.</span></p><h2>Doxology</h2><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>33</b>Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!<br/>How unsearchable his judgments,<br/>and his paths beyond tracing out!</span></p><p/><p><span><b>34</b>“Who has known the mind of the Lord?<br/>Or who has been his counselor?”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>35</b>“Who has ever given to God,<br/>that God should repay him?”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>36</b>For from him and through him and to him are all things.<br/>To him be the glory forever! Amen.</span></p>

<h1>Isaiah 17</h1><h2>An Oracle Against Damascus</h2><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>An oracle concerning Damascus:<br/>“See, Damascus will no longer be a city<br/>but will become a heap of ruins.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>The cities of Aroer will be deserted<br/>and left to flocks, which will lie down,<br/>with no one to make them afraid.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>The fortified city will disappear from Ephraim,<br/>and royal power from Damascus;<br/>the remnant of Aram will be<br/>like the glory of the Israelites,”<br/>declares the Lord Almighty.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>4</b>“In that day the glory of Jacob will fade;<br/>the fat of his body will waste away.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>It will be as when a reaper gathers the standing grain<br/>and harvests the grain with his arm—<br/>as when a man gleans heads of grain<br/>in the Valley of Rephaim.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>Yet some gleanings will remain,<br/>as when an olive tree is beaten,<br/>leaving two or three olives on the topmost branches,<br/>four or five on the fruitful boughs,”<br/>declares the Lord, the God of Israel.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>7</b>In that day men will look to their Maker<br/>and turn their eyes to the Holy One of Israel.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>They will not look to the altars,<br/>the work of their hands,<br/>and they will have no regard for the Asherah poles<br/>and the incense altars their fingers have made.</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>In that day their strong cities, which they left because of the Israelites, will be like places abandoned to thickets and undergrowth. And all will be desolation.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>You have forgotten God your Savior;<br/>you have not remembered the Rock, your fortress.<br/>Therefore, though you set out the finest plants<br/>and plant imported vines,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>though on the day you set them out, you make them grow,<br/>and on the morning when you plant them, you bring them to bud,<br/>yet the harvest will be as nothing<br/>in the day of disease and incurable pain.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>Oh, the raging of many nations—<br/>they rage like the raging sea!<br/>Oh, the uproar of the peoples—<br/>they roar like the roaring of great waters!</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>Although the peoples roar like the roar of surging waters,<br/>when he rebukes them they flee far away,<br/>driven before the wind like chaff on the hills,<br/>like tumbleweed before a gale.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>In the evening, sudden terror!<br/>Before the morning, they are gone!<br/>This is the portion of those who loot us,<br/>the lot of those who plunder us.</span></p>

<h1>Hebrews 4</h1><h2>A Sabbath‑Rest for the People of God</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.</span><span><b>2</b>For we also have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said,<br/>“So I declared on oath in my anger,<br/>‘They shall never enter my rest.’ ”And yet his work has been finished since the creation of the world.</span><span><b>4</b>For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: “And on the seventh day God rested from all his work.”</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>And again in the passage above he says, “They shall never enter my rest.”</span><span><b>6</b>It still remains that some will enter that rest, and those who formerly had the gospel preached to them did not go in, because of their disobedience.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>7</b>Therefore God again set a certain day, calling it Today, when a long time later he spoke through David, as was said before:<br/>“Today, if you hear his voice,<br/>do not harden your hearts.”</span><span><b>8</b>For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day.</span><span><b>9</b>There remains, then, a Sabbath‑rest for the people of God;</span><span><b>10</b>for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his.</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience.</span><span><b>12</b>For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double‑edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.</span></p><h2>Jesus the Great High Priest</h2><p><span><b>14</b>Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.</span><span><b>15</b>For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are–yet was without sin.</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.</span></p>

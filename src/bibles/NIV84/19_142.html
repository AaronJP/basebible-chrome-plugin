<h1>Psalm 142</h1><h2>A maskil of David. When he was in the cave. A prayer.</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>I cry aloud to the Lord;<br/>I lift up my voice to the Lord for mercy.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>I pour out my complaint before him;<br/>before him I tell my trouble.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>When my spirit grows faint within me,<br/>it is you who know my way.<br/>In the path where I walk<br/>men have hidden a snare for me.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>Look to my right and see;<br/>no one is concerned for me.<br/>I have no refuge;<br/>no one cares for my life.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>I cry to you, O Lord;<br/>I say, “You are my refuge,<br/>my portion in the land of the living.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>Listen to my cry,<br/>for I am in desperate need;<br/>rescue me from those who pursue me,<br/>for they are too strong for me.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>Set me free from my prison,<br/>that I may praise your name.<br/><br/>Then the righteous will gather about me<br/>because of your goodness to me.</span></p>

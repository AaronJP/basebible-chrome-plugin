<h1>1 Corinthians 13</h1><h2>Love</h2><p><span><b>1</b>If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.</span><span><b>2</b>If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.</span></p><p><span><b>3</b>If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing.</span><span><b>4</b>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.</span><span><b>5</b>It is not rude, it is not selfâ€‘seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.</span><span><b>6</b>Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.</span><span><b>8</b>Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.</span><span><b>9</b>For we know in part and we prophesy in part,</span><span><b>10</b>but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears.</span><span><b>11</b>When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.</span></p>

<h1>Hebrews 3</h1><h2>Jesus Greater Than Moses</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess.</span><span><b>2</b>He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God's house.</span><span><b>3</b>Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself.</span><span><b>4</b>For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.</span><span><b>5</b>Moses was faithful as a servant in all God's house, testifying to what would be said in the future.</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>But Christ is faithful as a son over God's house. And we are his house, if we hold on to our courage and the hope of which we boast.</span></p><h2>Warning Against Unbelief</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>So, as the Holy Spirit says:<br/>“Today, if you hear his voice,</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>do not harden your hearts<br/>as you did in the rebellion,<br/>during the time of testing in the desert,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>9</b>where your fathers tested and tried me<br/>and for forty years saw what I did.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>That is why I was angry with that generation,<br/>and I said, ‘Their hearts are always going astray,<br/>and they have not known my ways.’</span></p><p/><p><span><b>11</b>So I declared on oath in my anger,<br/>‘They shall never enter my rest.’ ”</span><span><b>12</b>See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.</span><span><b>13</b>But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness.</span><span><b>14</b>We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly till the end the confidence we had at first.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>As has just been said:<br/>“Today, if you hear his voice,<br/>do not harden your hearts<br/>as you did in the rebellion.”</span><span><b>16</b>Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt?</span><span><b>17</b>And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert?</span><span><b>18</b>And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed?</span></p><p><span><b>19</b>So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief.</span></p>

<h1>Revelation 4</h1><h2>The Throne in Heaven</h2><p><span><b>1</b>After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.”</span><span><b>2</b>At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it.</span><span><b>3</b>And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian. A rainbow, resembling an emerald, encircled the throne.</span><span><b>4</b>Surrounding the throne were twenty‑four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty‑four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads.</span><span><b>5</b>From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder. Before the throne, seven lamps were blazing. These are the seven spirits of God.</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>Also before the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal.<br/>In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, and they were covered with eyes, in front and in back.</span><span><b>7</b>The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under his wings. Day and night they never stop saying:<br/>“Holy, holy, holy<br/>is the Lord God Almighty,<br/>who was, and is, and is to come.”</span><span><b>9</b>Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever,</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>the twenty‑four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say:</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>“You are worthy, our Lord and God,<br/>to receive glory and honor and power,<br/>for you created all things,<br/>and by your will they were created<br/>and have their being.”</span></p>

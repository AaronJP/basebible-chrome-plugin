<h1>Isaiah 1</h1><p/><p><span><b>1</b>The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</span></p><h2>A Rebellious Nation</h2><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>Hear, O heavens! Listen, O earth!<br/>For the Lord has spoken:<br/>“I reared children and brought them up,<br/>but they have rebelled against me.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>The ox knows his master,<br/>the donkey his owner's manger,<br/>but Israel does not know,<br/>my people do not understand.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>Ah, sinful nation,<br/>a people loaded with guilt,<br/>a brood of evildoers,<br/>children given to corruption!<br/>They have forsaken the Lord;<br/>they have spurned the Holy One of Israel<br/>and turned their backs on him.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>Why should you be beaten anymore?<br/>Why do you persist in rebellion?<br/>Your whole head is injured,<br/>your whole heart afflicted.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>From the sole of your foot to the top of your head<br/>there is no soundness—<br/>only wounds and welts<br/>and open sores,<br/>not cleansed or bandaged<br/>or soothed with oil.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>Your country is desolate,<br/>your cities burned with fire;<br/>your fields are being stripped by foreigners<br/>right before you,<br/>laid waste as when overthrown by strangers.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>The Daughter of Zion is left<br/>like a shelter in a vineyard,<br/>like a hut in a field of melons,<br/>like a city under siege.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>Unless the Lord Almighty<br/>had left us some survivors,<br/>we would have become like Sodom,<br/>we would have been like Gomorrah.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>Hear the word of the Lord,<br/>you rulers of Sodom;<br/>listen to the law of our God,<br/>you people of Gomorrah!</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>“The multitude of your sacrifices—<br/>what are they to me?” says the Lord.<br/>“I have more than enough of burnt offerings,<br/>of rams and the fat of fattened animals;<br/>I have no pleasure<br/>in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>When you come to appear before me,<br/>who has asked this of you,<br/>this trampling of my courts?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>Stop bringing meaningless offerings!<br/>Your incense is detestable to me.<br/>New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations—<br/>I cannot bear your evil assemblies.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts<br/>my soul hates.<br/>They have become a burden to me;<br/>I am weary of bearing them.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>When you spread out your hands in prayer,<br/>I will hide my eyes from you;<br/>even if you offer many prayers,<br/>I will not listen.<br/>Your hands are full of blood;</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>wash and make yourselves clean.<br/>Take your evil deeds<br/>out of my sight!<br/>Stop doing wrong,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>learn to do right!<br/>Seek justice,<br/>encourage the oppressed.<br/>Defend the cause of the fatherless,<br/>plead the case of the widow.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>“Come now, let us reason together,”<br/>says the Lord.<br/>“Though your sins are like scarlet,<br/>they shall be as white as snow;<br/>though they are red as crimson,<br/>they shall be like wool.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>19</b>If you are willing and obedient,<br/>you will eat the best from the land;</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>but if you resist and rebel,<br/>you will be devoured by the sword.”<br/>For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>21</b>See how the faithful city<br/>has become a harlot!<br/>She once was full of justice;<br/>righteousness used to dwell in her—<br/>but now murderers!</span></p><p/><p><span><b>22</b>Your silver has become dross,<br/>your choice wine is diluted with water.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>23</b>Your rulers are rebels,<br/>companions of thieves;<br/>they all love bribes<br/>and chase after gifts.<br/>They do not defend the cause of the fatherless;<br/>the widow's case does not come before them.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>24</b>Therefore the Lord, the Lord Almighty,<br/>the Mighty One of Israel, declares:<br/>“Ah, I will get relief from my foes<br/>and avenge myself on my enemies.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>25</b>I will turn my hand against you;<br/>I will thoroughly purge away your dross<br/>and remove all your impurities.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>26</b>I will restore your judges as in days of old,<br/>your counselors as at the beginning.<br/>Afterward you will be called<br/>the City of Righteousness,<br/>the Faithful City.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>27</b>Zion will be redeemed with justice,<br/>her penitent ones with righteousness.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>28</b>But rebels and sinners will both be broken,<br/>and those who forsake the Lord will perish.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>29</b>“You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks<br/>in which you have delighted;<br/>you will be disgraced because of the gardens<br/>that you have chosen.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>30</b>You will be like an oak with fading leaves,<br/>like a garden without water.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>31</b>The mighty man will become tinder<br/>and his work a spark;<br/>both will burn together,<br/>with no one to quench the fire.”</span></p>

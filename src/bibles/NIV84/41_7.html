<h1>Mark 7</h1><h2>Clean and Unclean</h2><p><span><b>1</b>The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and</span><span><b>2</b>saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were “unclean,” that is, unwashed.</span><span><b>3</b>(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders.</span></p><p><span><b>4</b>When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles.)</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, “Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with ‘unclean’ hands?”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>He replied, “Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written:<br/>“ ‘These people honor me with their lips,<br/>but their hearts are far from me.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>They worship me in vain;<br/>their teachings are but rules taught by men.’</span></p><p><span><b>8</b>You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men.”</span><span><b>9</b>And he said to them: “You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!</span><span><b>10</b>For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’</span><span><b>11</b>But you say that if a man says to his father or mother: ‘Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban’ (that is, a gift devoted to God),</span><span><b>12</b>then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother.</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.”</span><span><b>14</b>Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, “Listen to me, everyone, and understand this.</span></p><p><span><b>15</b>Nothing outside a man can make him ‘unclean’ by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him ‘unclean.’ ”</span><span><b>17</b>After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.</span><span><b>18</b>“Are you so dull?” he asked. “Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him ‘unclean’?</span></p><p><span><b>19</b>For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body.” (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods “clean.”)</span><span><b>20</b>He went on: “What comes out of a man is what makes him ‘unclean.’</span><span><b>21</b>For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,</span><span><b>22</b>greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly.</span></p><p><span><b>23</b>All these evils come from inside and make a man ‘unclean.’ ”</span></p><h2>The Faith of a Syrophoenician Woman</h2><p><span><b>24</b>Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret.</span><span><b>25</b>In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil spirit came and fell at his feet.</span></p><p><span><b>26</b>The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.</span></p><p><span><b>27</b>“First let the children eat all they want,” he told her, “for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs.”</span></p><p><span><b>28</b>“Yes, Lord,” she replied, “but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.”</span></p><p><span><b>29</b>Then he told her, “For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter.”</span></p><p><span><b>30</b>She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.</span></p><h2>The Healing of a Deaf and Mute Man</h2><p><span><b>31</b>Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis.</span></p><p><span><b>32</b>There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man.</span><span><b>33</b>After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue.</span><span><b>34</b>He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, “Ephphatha!” (which means, “Be opened!” ).</span></p><p><span><b>35</b>At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly.</span><span><b>36</b>Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it.</span></p><p><span><b>37</b>People were overwhelmed with amazement. “He has done everything well,” they said. “He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.”</span></p>

<h1>Titus 1</h1><p><span><b>1</b>Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of God's elect and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness–</span><span><b>2</b>a faith and knowledge resting on the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before the beginning of time,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>and at his appointed season he brought his word to light through the preaching entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior,</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>To Titus, my true son in our common faith:<br/><br/>Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.</span></p><h2>Titus' Task on Crete</h2><p><span><b>5</b>The reason I left you in Crete was that you might straighten out what was left unfinished and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you.</span><span><b>6</b>An elder must be blameless, the husband of but one wife, a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient.</span><span><b>7</b>Since an overseer is entrusted with God's work, he must be blameless–not overbearing, not quick‑tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain.</span><span><b>8</b>Rather he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self‑controlled, upright, holy and disciplined.</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.</span><span><b>10</b>For there are many rebellious people, mere talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision group.</span><span><b>11</b>They must be silenced, because they are ruining whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach–and that for the sake of dishonest gain.</span><span><b>12</b>Even one of their own prophets has said, “Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons.”</span><span><b>13</b>This testimony is true. Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith</span><span><b>14</b>and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of those who reject the truth.</span><span><b>15</b>To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted.</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good.</span></p>

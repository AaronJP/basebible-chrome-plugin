<h1>1 Peter 5</h1><h2>To Elders and Young Men</h2><p><span><b>1</b>To the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow elder, a witness of Christ's sufferings and one who also will share in the glory to be revealed:</span><span><b>2</b>Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care, serving as overseers–not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not greedy for money, but eager to serve;</span><span><b>3</b>not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.</span></p><p><span><b>4</b>And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>Young men, in the same way be submissive to those who are older. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because,<br/>“God opposes the proud<br/>but gives grace to the humble.”</span><span><b>6</b>Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.</span><span><b>8</b>Be self‑controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of sufferings.</span><span><b>10</b>And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast.</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>To him be the power for ever and ever. Amen.</span></p><h2>Final Greetings</h2><p><span><b>12</b>With the help of Silas, whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it.</span><span><b>13</b>She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you her greetings, and so does my son Mark.</span><span><b>14</b>Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.</span></p>

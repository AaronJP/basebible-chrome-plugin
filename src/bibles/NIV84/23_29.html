<h1>Isaiah 29</h1><h2>Woe to David's City</h2><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Woe to you, Ariel, Ariel,<br/>the city where David settled!<br/>Add year to year<br/>and let your cycle of festivals go on.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>Yet I will besiege Ariel;<br/>she will mourn and lament,<br/>she will be to me like an altar hearth.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>I will encamp against you all around;<br/>I will encircle you with towers<br/>and set up my siege works against you.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>Brought low, you will speak from the ground;<br/>your speech will mumble out of the dust.<br/>Your voice will come ghostlike from the earth;<br/>out of the dust your speech will whisper.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>But your many enemies will become like fine dust,<br/>the ruthless hordes like blown chaff.<br/>Suddenly, in an instant,</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>the Lord Almighty will come<br/>with thunder and earthquake and great noise,<br/>with windstorm and tempest and flames of a devouring fire.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>Then the hordes of all the nations that fight against Ariel,<br/>that attack her and her fortress and besiege her,<br/>will be as it is with a dream,<br/>with a vision in the night—</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>as when a hungry man dreams that he is eating,<br/>but he awakens, and his hunger remains;<br/>as when a thirsty man dreams that he is drinking,<br/>but he awakens faint, with his thirst unquenched.<br/>So will it be with the hordes of all the nations<br/>that fight against Mount Zion.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>Be stunned and amazed,<br/>blind yourselves and be sightless;<br/>be drunk, but not from wine,<br/>stagger, but not from beer.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>The Lord has brought over you a deep sleep:<br/>He has sealed your eyes (the prophets);<br/>he has covered your heads (the seers).</span><span><b>11</b>For you this whole vision is nothing but words sealed in a scroll. And if you give the scroll to someone who can read, and say to him, “Read this, please,” he will answer, “I can't; it is sealed.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>12</b>Or if you give the scroll to someone who cannot read, and say, “Read this, please,” he will answer, “I don't know how to read.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>The Lord says:<br/>“These people come near to me with their mouth<br/>and honor me with their lips,<br/>but their hearts are far from me.<br/>Their worship of me<br/>is made up only of rules taught by men.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>Therefore once more I will astound these people<br/>with wonder upon wonder;<br/>the wisdom of the wise will perish,<br/>the intelligence of the intelligent will vanish.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>Woe to those who go to great depths<br/>to hide their plans from the Lord,<br/>who do their work in darkness and think,<br/>“Who sees us? Who will know?”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>You turn things upside down,<br/>as if the potter were thought to be like the clay!<br/>Shall what is formed say to him who formed it,<br/>“He did not make me”?<br/>Can the pot say of the potter,<br/>“He knows nothing”?</span></p><p/><p><span><b>17</b>In a very short time, will not Lebanon be turned into a fertile field<br/>and the fertile field seem like a forest?</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>In that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll,<br/>and out of gloom and darkness<br/>the eyes of the blind will see.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>19</b>Once more the humble will rejoice in the Lord;<br/>the needy will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>The ruthless will vanish,<br/>the mockers will disappear,<br/>and all who have an eye for evil will be cut down—</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>21</b>those who with a word make a man out to be guilty,<br/>who ensnare the defender in court<br/>and with false testimony deprive the innocent of justice.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>22</b>Therefore this is what the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, says to the house of Jacob:<br/>“No longer will Jacob be ashamed;<br/>no longer will their faces grow pale.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>23</b>When they see among them their children,<br/>the work of my hands,<br/>they will keep my name holy;<br/>they will acknowledge the holiness of the Holy One of Jacob,<br/>and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>24</b>Those who are wayward in spirit will gain understanding;<br/>those who complain will accept instruction.”</span></p>

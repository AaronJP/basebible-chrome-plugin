<h1>Acts 24</h1><h2>The Trial Before Felix</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Five days later the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor.</span><span><b>2</b>When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented his case before Felix: “We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation.</span><span><b>3</b>Everywhere and in every way, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with profound gratitude.</span></p><p><span><b>4</b>But in order not to weary you further, I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly.</span><span><b>5</b>“We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect</span><span><b>6</b>and even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him.</span></p><p><span><b>8</b>By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him.”</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>The Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true.</span><span><b>10</b>When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: “I know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation; so I gladly make my defense.</span><span><b>11</b>You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.</span><span><b>12</b>My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city.</span><span><b>13</b>And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me.</span><span><b>14</b>However, I admit that I worship the God of our fathers as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that agrees with the Law and that is written in the Prophets,</span><span><b>15</b>and I have the same hope in God as these men, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.</span><span><b>17</b>“After an absence of several years, I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings.</span><span><b>18</b>I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this. There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance.</span><span><b>19</b>But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me.</span><span><b>20</b>Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin–</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence: ‘It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’ ”</span><span><b>22</b>Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. “When Lysias the commander comes,” he said, “I will decide your case.”</span></p><p><span><b>23</b>He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs.</span><span><b>24</b>Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus.</span><span><b>25</b>As Paul discoursed on righteousness, self‑control and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, “That's enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you.”</span></p><p><span><b>26</b>At the same time he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent for him frequently and talked with him.</span></p><p><span><b>27</b>When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but because Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews, he left Paul in prison.</span></p>

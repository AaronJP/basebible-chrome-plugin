<h1>Jeremiah 6</h1><h2>Jerusalem Under Siege</h2><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>“Flee for safety, people of Benjamin!<br/>Flee from Jerusalem!<br/>Sound the trumpet in Tekoa!<br/>Raise the signal over Beth Hakkerem!<br/>For disaster looms out of the north,<br/>even terrible destruction.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>2</b>I will destroy the Daughter of Zion,<br/>so beautiful and delicate.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>Shepherds with their flocks will come against her;<br/>they will pitch their tents around her,<br/>each tending his own portion.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>“Prepare for battle against her!<br/>Arise, let us attack at noon!<br/>But, alas, the daylight is fading,<br/>and the shadows of evening grow long.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>So arise, let us attack at night<br/>and destroy her fortresses!”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>This is what the Lord Almighty says:<br/>“Cut down the trees<br/>and build siege ramps against Jerusalem.<br/>This city must be punished;<br/>it is filled with oppression.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>As a well pours out its water,<br/>so she pours out her wickedness.<br/>Violence and destruction resound in her;<br/>her sickness and wounds are ever before me.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>Take warning, O Jerusalem,<br/>or I will turn away from you<br/>and make your land desolate<br/>so no one can live in it.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>This is what the Lord Almighty says:<br/>“Let them glean the remnant of Israel<br/>as thoroughly as a vine;<br/>pass your hand over the branches again,<br/>like one gathering grapes.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>To whom can I speak and give warning?<br/>Who will listen to me?<br/>Their ears are closed<br/>so they cannot hear.<br/>The word of the Lord is offensive to them;<br/>they find no pleasure in it.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>But I am full of the wrath of the Lord,<br/>and I cannot hold it in.<br/><br/>“Pour it out on the children in the street<br/>and on the young men gathered together;<br/>both husband and wife will be caught in it,<br/>and the old, those weighed down with years.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>Their houses will be turned over to others,<br/>together with their fields and their wives,<br/>when I stretch out my hand<br/>against those who live in the land,”<br/>declares the Lord.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>“From the least to the greatest,<br/>all are greedy for gain;<br/>prophets and priests alike,<br/>all practice deceit.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>They dress the wound of my people<br/>as though it were not serious.<br/>‘Peace, peace,’ they say,<br/>when there is no peace.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>Are they ashamed of their loathsome conduct?<br/>No, they have no shame at all;<br/>they do not even know how to blush.<br/>So they will fall among the fallen;<br/>they will be brought down when I punish them,”<br/>says the Lord.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>This is what the Lord says:<br/>“Stand at the crossroads and look;<br/>ask for the ancient paths,<br/>ask where the good way is, and walk in it,<br/>and you will find rest for your souls.<br/>But you said, ‘We will not walk in it.’</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>I appointed watchmen over you and said,<br/>‘Listen to the sound of the trumpet!’<br/>But you said, ‘We will not listen.’</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>Therefore hear, O nations;<br/>observe, O witnesses,<br/>what will happen to them.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>Hear, O earth:<br/>I am bringing disaster on this people,<br/>the fruit of their schemes,<br/>because they have not listened to my words<br/>and have rejected my law.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>What do I care about incense from Sheba<br/>or sweet calamus from a distant land?<br/>Your burnt offerings are not acceptable;<br/>your sacrifices do not please me.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>21</b>Therefore this is what the Lord says:<br/>“I will put obstacles before this people.<br/>Fathers and sons alike will stumble over them;<br/>neighbors and friends will perish.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>22</b>This is what the Lord says:<br/>“Look, an army is coming<br/>from the land of the north;<br/>a great nation is being stirred up<br/>from the ends of the earth.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>23</b>They are armed with bow and spear;<br/>they are cruel and show no mercy.<br/>They sound like the roaring sea<br/>as they ride on their horses;<br/>they come like men in battle formation<br/>to attack you, O Daughter of Zion.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>24</b>We have heard reports about them,<br/>and our hands hang limp.<br/>Anguish has gripped us,<br/>pain like that of a woman in labor.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>25</b>Do not go out to the fields<br/>or walk on the roads,<br/>for the enemy has a sword,<br/>and there is terror on every side.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>26</b>O my people, put on sackcloth<br/>and roll in ashes;<br/>mourn with bitter wailing<br/>as for an only son,<br/>for suddenly the destroyer<br/>will come upon us.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>27</b>“I have made you a tester of metals<br/>and my people the ore,<br/>that you may observe<br/>and test their ways.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>28</b>They are all hardened rebels,<br/>going about to slander.<br/>They are bronze and iron;<br/>they all act corruptly.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>29</b>The bellows blow fiercely<br/>to burn away the lead with fire,<br/>but the refining goes on in vain;<br/>the wicked are not purged out.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>30</b>They are called rejected silver,<br/>because the Lord has rejected them.”</span></p>

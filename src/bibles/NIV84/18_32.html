<h1>Job 32</h1><h2>Elihu</h2><p><span><b>1</b>So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</span><span><b>2</b>But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God.</span><span><b>3</b>He was also angry with the three friends, because they had found no way to refute Job, and yet had condemned him.</span><span><b>4</b>Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because they were older than he.</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>But when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say, his anger was aroused.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said:<br/>“I am young in years,<br/>and you are old;<br/>that is why I was fearful,<br/>not daring to tell you what I know.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>7</b>I thought, ‘Age should speak;<br/>advanced years should teach wisdom.’</span></p><p/><p><span><b>8</b>But it is the spirit in a man,<br/>the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>It is not only the old who are wise,<br/>not only the aged who understand what is right.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>10</b>“Therefore I say: Listen to me;<br/>I too will tell you what I know.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>I waited while you spoke,<br/>I listened to your reasoning;<br/>while you were searching for words,</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>I gave you my full attention.<br/>But not one of you has proved Job wrong;<br/>none of you has answered his arguments.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>13</b>Do not say, ‘We have found wisdom;<br/>let God refute him, not man.’</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>But Job has not marshaled his words against me,<br/>and I will not answer him with your arguments.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>15</b>“They are dismayed and have no more to say;<br/>words have failed them.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>16</b>Must I wait, now that they are silent,<br/>now that they stand there with no reply?</span></p><p/><p><span><b>17</b>I too will have my say;<br/>I too will tell what I know.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>18</b>For I am full of words,<br/>and the spirit within me compels me;</span></p><p/><p><span><b>19</b>inside I am like bottled-up wine,<br/>like new wineskins ready to burst.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>20</b>I must speak and find relief;<br/>I must open my lips and reply.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>21</b>I will show partiality to no one,<br/>nor will I flatter any man;</span></p><p/><p><span><b>22</b>for if I were skilled in flattery,<br/>my Maker would soon take me away.</span></p>

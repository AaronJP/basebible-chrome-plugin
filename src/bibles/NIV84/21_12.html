<h1>Ecclesiastes 12</h1><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Remember your Creator<br/>in the days of your youth,<br/>before the days of trouble come<br/>and the years approach when you will say,<br/>“I find no pleasure in them”—</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>before the sun and the light<br/>and the moon and the stars grow dark,<br/>and the clouds return after the rain;</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>when the keepers of the house tremble,<br/>and the strong men stoop,<br/>when the grinders cease because they are few,<br/>and those looking through the windows grow dim;</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>when the doors to the street are closed<br/>and the sound of grinding fades;<br/>when men rise up at the sound of birds,<br/>but all their songs grow faint;</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>when men are afraid of heights<br/>and of dangers in the streets;<br/>when the almond tree blossoms<br/>and the grasshopper drags himself along<br/>and desire no longer is stirred.<br/>Then man goes to his eternal home<br/>and mourners go about the streets.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>Remember him—before the silver cord is severed,<br/>or the golden bowl is broken;<br/>before the pitcher is shattered at the spring,<br/>or the wheel broken at the well,</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>and the dust returns to the ground it came from,<br/>and the spirit returns to God who gave it.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>8</b>“Meaningless! Meaningless!” says the Teacher.<br/>“Everything is meaningless!”</span></p><h2>The Conclusion of the Matter</h2><p><span><b>9</b>Not only was the Teacher wise, but also he imparted knowledge to the people. He pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs.</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>The Teacher searched to find just the right words, and what he wrote was upright and true.</span><span><b>11</b>The words of the wise are like goads, their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails—given by one Shepherd.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>12</b>Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them.<br/>Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>Now all has been heard;<br/>here is the conclusion of the matter:<br/>Fear God and keep his commandments,<br/>for this is the whole<i> duty</i>of man.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>14</b>For God will bring every deed into judgment,<br/>including every hidden thing,<br/>whether it is good or evil.</span></p>

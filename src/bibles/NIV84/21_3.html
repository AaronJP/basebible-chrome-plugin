<h1>Ecclesiastes 3</h1><h2>A Time for Everything</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>There is a time for everything,<br/>and a season for every activity under heaven:</span></p><p/><p><span><b>2</b>a time to be born and a time to die,<br/>a time to plant and a time to uproot,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>a time to kill and a time to heal,<br/>a time to tear down and a time to build,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>4</b>a time to weep and a time to laugh,<br/>a time to mourn and a time to dance,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,<br/>a time to embrace and a time to refrain,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>6</b>a time to search and a time to give up,<br/>a time to keep and a time to throw away,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>7</b>a time to tear and a time to mend,<br/>a time to be silent and a time to speak,</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>a time to love and a time to hate,<br/>a time for war and a time for peace.</span><span><b>9</b>What does the worker gain from his toil?</span><span><b>10</b>I have seen the burden God has laid on men.</span><span><b>11</b>He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end.</span><span><b>12</b>I know that there is nothing better for men than to be happy and do good while they live.</span><span><b>13</b>That everyone may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all his toil—this is the gift of God.</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that men will revere him.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>Whatever is has already been,<br/>and what will be has been before;<br/>and God will call the past to account.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>And I saw something else under the sun:<br/>In the place of judgment—wickedness was there,<br/>in the place of justice—wickedness was there.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>I thought in my heart,<br/>“God will bring to judgment<br/>both the righteous and the wicked,<br/>for there will be a time for every activity,<br/>a time for every deed.”</span><span><b>18</b>I also thought, “As for men, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals.</span><span><b>19</b>Man's fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; man has no advantage over the animal. Everything is meaningless.</span><span><b>20</b>All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return.</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>Who knows if the spirit of man rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?”</span></p><p><span><b>22</b>So I saw that there is nothing better for a man than to enjoy his work, because that is his lot. For who can bring him to see what will happen after him?</span></p>

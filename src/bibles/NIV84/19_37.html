<h1>Psalm 37</h1><h2>Of David.</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Do not fret because of evil men<br/>or be envious of those who do wrong;</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>for like the grass they will soon wither,<br/>like green plants they will soon die away.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>Trust in the Lord and do good;<br/>dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>Delight yourself in the Lord<br/>and he will give you the desires of your heart.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>Commit your way to the Lord;<br/>trust in him and he will do this:</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>He will make your righteousness shine like the dawn,<br/>the justice of your cause like the noonday sun.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him;<br/>do not fret when men succeed in their ways,<br/>when they carry out their wicked schemes.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>8</b>Refrain from anger and turn from wrath;<br/>do not fret—it leads only to evil.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>For evil men will be cut off,<br/>but those who hope in the Lord will inherit the land.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>10</b>A little while, and the wicked will be no more;<br/>though you look for them, they will not be found.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>But the meek will inherit the land<br/>and enjoy great peace.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>12</b>The wicked plot against the righteous<br/>and gnash their teeth at them;</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>but the Lord laughs at the wicked,<br/>for he knows their day is coming.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>The wicked draw the sword<br/>and bend the bow<br/>to bring down the poor and needy,<br/>to slay those whose ways are upright.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>But their swords will pierce their own hearts,<br/>and their bows will be broken.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>16</b>Better the little that the righteous have<br/>than the wealth of many wicked;</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>for the power of the wicked will be broken,<br/>but the Lord upholds the righteous.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>18</b>The days of the blameless are known to the Lord,<br/>and their inheritance will endure forever.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>In times of disaster they will not wither;<br/>in days of famine they will enjoy plenty.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>But the wicked will perish:<br/>The Lord's enemies will be like the beauty of the fields,<br/>they will vanish—vanish like smoke.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>21</b>The wicked borrow and do not repay,<br/>but the righteous give generously;</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>22</b>those the Lord blesses will inherit the land,<br/>but those he curses will be cut off.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>23</b>If the Lord delights in a man's way,<br/>he makes his steps firm;</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>24</b>though he stumble, he will not fall,<br/>for the Lord upholds him with his hand.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>25</b>I was young and now I am old,<br/>yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken<br/>or their children begging bread.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>26</b>They are always generous and lend freely;<br/>their children will be blessed.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>27</b>Turn from evil and do good;<br/>then you will dwell in the land forever.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>28</b>For the Lord loves the just<br/>and will not forsake his faithful ones.<br/><br/>They will be protected forever,<br/>but the offspring of the wicked will be cut off;</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>29</b>the righteous will inherit the land<br/>and dwell in it forever.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>30</b>The mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom,<br/>and his tongue speaks what is just.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>31</b>The law of his God is in his heart;<br/>his feet do not slip.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>32</b>The wicked lie in wait for the righteous,<br/>seeking their very lives;</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>33</b>but the Lord will not leave them in their power<br/>or let them be condemned when brought to trial.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>34</b>Wait for the Lord<br/>and keep his way.<br/>He will exalt you to inherit the land;<br/>when the wicked are cut off, you will see it.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>35</b>I have seen a wicked and ruthless man<br/>flourishing like a green tree in its native soil,</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>36</b>but he soon passed away and was no more;<br/>though I looked for him, he could not be found.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>37</b>Consider the blameless, observe the upright;<br/>there is a future for the man of peace.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>38</b>But all sinners will be destroyed;<br/>the future of the wicked will be cut off.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>39</b>The salvation of the righteous comes from the Lord;<br/>he is their stronghold in time of trouble.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>40</b>The Lord helps them and delivers them;<br/>he delivers them from the wicked and saves them,<br/>because they take refuge in him.</span></p>

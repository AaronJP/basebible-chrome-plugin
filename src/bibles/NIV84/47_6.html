<h1>2 Corinthians 6</h1><p><span><b>1</b>As God's fellow workers we urge you not to receive God's grace in vain.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>For he says,<br/>“In the time of my favor I heard you,<br/>and in the day of salvation I helped you.”I tell you, now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation.</span></p><h2>Paul's Hardships</h2><p><span><b>3</b>We put no stumbling block in anyone's path, so that our ministry will not be discredited.</span><span><b>4</b>Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships and distresses;</span><span><b>5</b>in beatings, imprisonments and riots; in hard work, sleepless nights and hunger;</span><span><b>6</b>in purity, understanding, patience and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love;</span><span><b>7</b>in truthful speech and in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;</span><span><b>8</b>through glory and dishonor, bad report and good report; genuine, yet regarded as impostors;</span><span><b>9</b>known, yet regarded as unknown; dying, and yet we live on; beaten, and yet not killed;</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything.</span><span><b>11</b>We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians, and opened wide our hearts to you.</span><span><b>12</b>We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours from us.</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>As a fair exchange–I speak as to my children–open wide your hearts also.</span></p><h2>Do Not Be Yoked With Unbelievers</h2><p><span><b>14</b>Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?</span><span><b>15</b>What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: “I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>“Therefore come out from them<br/>and be separate,<br/>says the Lord.<br/>Touch no unclean thing,<br/>and I will receive you.”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>“I will be a Father to you,<br/>and you will be my sons and daughters,<br/>says the Lord Almighty.”</span></p>

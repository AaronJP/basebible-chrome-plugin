<h1>Isaiah 41</h1><h2>The Helper of Israel</h2><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>“Be silent before me, you islands!<br/>Let the nations renew their strength!<br/>Let them come forward and speak;<br/>let us meet together at the place of judgment.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>“Who has stirred up one from the east,<br/>calling him in righteousness to his service?<br/>He hands nations over to him<br/>and subdues kings before him.<br/>He turns them to dust with his sword,<br/>to windblown chaff with his bow.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>He pursues them and moves on unscathed,<br/>by a path his feet have not traveled before.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>Who has done this and carried it through,<br/>calling forth the generations from the beginning?<br/>I, the Lord—with the first of them<br/>and with the last—I am he.”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>The islands have seen it and fear;<br/>the ends of the earth tremble.<br/>They approach and come forward;</span></p><p/><p><span><b>6</b>each helps the other<br/>and says to his brother, “Be strong!”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>The craftsman encourages the goldsmith,<br/>and he who smooths with the hammer<br/>spurs on him who strikes the anvil.<br/>He says of the welding, “It is good.”<br/>He nails down the idol so it will not topple.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>“But you, O Israel, my servant,<br/>Jacob, whom I have chosen,<br/>you descendants of Abraham my friend,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>I took you from the ends of the earth,<br/>from its farthest corners I called you.<br/>I said, ‘You are my servant’;<br/>I have chosen you and have not rejected you.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>So do not fear, for I am with you;<br/>do not be dismayed, for I am your God.<br/>I will strengthen you and help you;<br/>I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>“All who rage against you<br/>will surely be ashamed and disgraced;<br/>those who oppose you<br/>will be as nothing and perish.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>Though you search for your enemies,<br/>you will not find them.<br/>Those who wage war against you<br/>will be as nothing at all.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>For I am the Lord, your God,<br/>who takes hold of your right hand<br/>and says to you, Do not fear;<br/>I will help you.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>Do not be afraid, O worm Jacob,<br/>O little Israel,<br/>for I myself will help you,” declares the Lord,<br/>your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>“See, I will make you into a threshing sledge,<br/>new and sharp, with many teeth.<br/>You will thresh the mountains and crush them,<br/>and reduce the hills to chaff.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>You will winnow them, the wind will pick them up,<br/>and a gale will blow them away.<br/>But you will rejoice in the Lord<br/>and glory in the Holy One of Israel.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>“The poor and needy search for water,<br/>but there is none;<br/>their tongues are parched with thirst.<br/>But I the Lord will answer them;<br/>I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>I will make rivers flow on barren heights,<br/>and springs within the valleys.<br/>I will turn the desert into pools of water,<br/>and the parched ground into springs.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>I will put in the desert<br/>the cedar and the acacia, the myrtle and the olive.<br/>I will set pines in the wasteland,<br/>the fir and the cypress together,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>so that people may see and know,<br/>may consider and understand,<br/>that the hand of the Lord has done this,<br/>that the Holy One of Israel has created it.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>21</b>“Present your case,” says the Lord.<br/>“Set forth your arguments,” says Jacob's King.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>22</b>“Bring in<i> your idols</i>to tell us<br/>what is going to happen.<br/>Tell us what the former things were,<br/>so that we may consider them<br/>and know their final outcome.<br/>Or declare to us the things to come,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>23</b>tell us what the future holds,<br/>so we may know that you are gods.<br/>Do something, whether good or bad,<br/>so that we will be dismayed and filled with fear.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>24</b>But you are less than nothing<br/>and your works are utterly worthless;<br/>he who chooses you is detestable.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>25</b>“I have stirred up one from the north, and he comes—<br/>one from the rising sun who calls on my name.<br/>He treads on rulers as if they were mortar,<br/>as if he were a potter treading the clay.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>26</b>Who told of this from the beginning, so we could know,<br/>or beforehand, so we could say, ‘He was right’?<br/>No one told of this,<br/>no one foretold it,<br/>no one heard any words from you.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>27</b>I was the first to tell Zion, ‘Look, here they are!’<br/>I gave to Jerusalem a messenger of good tidings.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>28</b>I look but there is no one—<br/>no one among them to give counsel,<br/>no one to give answer when I ask them.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>29</b>See, they are all false!<br/>Their deeds amount to nothing;<br/>their images are but wind and confusion.</span></p>

<h1>Titus 2</h1><h2>What Must Be Taught to Various Groups</h2><p><span><b>1</b>You must teach what is in accord with sound doctrine.</span></p><p><span><b>2</b>Teach the older men to be temperate, worthy of respect, self‑controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.</span><span><b>3</b>Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good.</span><span><b>4</b>Then they can train the younger women to love their husbands and children,</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>to be self‑controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God.</span><span><b>6</b>Similarly, encourage the young men to be self‑controlled.</span><span><b>7</b>In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness</span></p><p><span><b>8</b>and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.</span><span><b>9</b>Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them,</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive.</span><span><b>11</b>For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men.</span><span><b>12</b>It teaches us to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self‑controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age,</span><span><b>13</b>while we wait for the blessed hope–the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.</span></p><p><span><b>15</b>These, then, are the things you should teach. Encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise you.</span></p>

<h1>Genesis 15</h1><h2>God's Covenant With Abram</h2><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>After this, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision:<br/>“Do not be afraid, Abram.<br/>I am your shield,<br/>your very great reward.”</span><span><b>2</b>But Abram said, “O Sovereign Lord, what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?”</span></p><p><span><b>3</b>And Abram said, “You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir.”</span><span><b>4</b>Then the word of the Lord came to him: “This man will not be your heir, but a son coming from your own body will be your heir.”</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>He took him outside and said, “Look up at the heavens and count the stars—if indeed you can count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring be.”</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>He also said to him, “I am the Lord, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it.”</span></p><p><span><b>8</b>But Abram said, “O Sovereign Lord, how can I know that I will gain possession of it?”</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>So the Lord said to him, “Bring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon.”</span><span><b>10</b>Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half.</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.</span><span><b>12</b>As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him.</span><span><b>13</b>Then the Lord said to him, “Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years.</span><span><b>14</b>But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions.</span><span><b>15</b>You, however, will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a good old age.</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.”</span><span><b>17</b>When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces.</span><span><b>18</b>On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram and said, “To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates—</span><span><b>19</b>the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,</span><span><b>20</b>Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.”</span></p>

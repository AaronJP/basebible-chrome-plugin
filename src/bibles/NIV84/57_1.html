<h1>Philemon 1</h1><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,<br/><br/>To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>2</b>to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home:</span></p><p><span><b>3</b>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p><h2>Thanksgiving and Prayer</h2><p><span><b>4</b>I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,</span><span><b>5</b>because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.</span><span><b>6</b>I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.</span></p><h2>Paul's Plea for Onesimus</h2><p><span><b>8</b>Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,</span><span><b>9</b>yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then, as Paul–an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus–</span><span><b>10</b>I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, who became my son while I was in chains.</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.</span><span><b>12</b>I am sending him–who is my very heart–back to you.</span><span><b>13</b>I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.</span><span><b>14</b>But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do will be spontaneous and not forced.</span><span><b>15</b>Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back for good–</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.</span><span><b>17</b>So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.</span><span><b>18</b>If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.</span><span><b>19</b>I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back–not to mention that you owe me your very self.</span><span><b>20</b>I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>22</b>And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.</span><span><b>23</b>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.</span></p><p><span><b>24</b>And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.</span><span><b>25</b>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</span></p>

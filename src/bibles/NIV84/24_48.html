<h1>Jeremiah 48</h1><h2>A Message About Moab</h2><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Concerning Moab:<br/><br/>This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says:<br/>“Woe to Nebo, for it will be ruined.<br/>Kiriathaim will be disgraced and captured;<br/>the stronghold will be disgraced and shattered.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>Moab will be praised no more;<br/>in Heshbon men will plot her downfall:<br/>‘Come, let us put an end to that nation.’<br/>You too, O Madmen, will be silenced;<br/>the sword will pursue you.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>Listen to the cries from Horonaim,<br/>cries of great havoc and destruction.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>4</b>Moab will be broken;<br/>her little ones will cry out.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>They go up the way to Luhith,<br/>weeping bitterly as they go;<br/>on the road down to Horonaim<br/>anguished cries over the destruction are heard.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>6</b>Flee! Run for your lives;<br/>become like a bush in the desert.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>Since you trust in your deeds and riches,<br/>you too will be taken captive,<br/>and Chemosh will go into exile,<br/>together with his priests and officials.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>The destroyer will come against every town,<br/>and not a town will escape.<br/>The valley will be ruined<br/>and the plateau destroyed,<br/>because the Lord has spoken.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>Put salt on Moab,<br/>for she will be laid waste;<br/>her towns will become desolate,<br/>with no one to live in them.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>“A curse on him who is lax in doing the Lord's work!<br/>A curse on him who keeps his sword from bloodshed!</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>“Moab has been at rest from youth,<br/>like wine left on its dregs,<br/>not poured from one jar to another—<br/>she has not gone into exile.<br/>So she tastes as she did,<br/>and her aroma is unchanged.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>But days are coming,”<br/>declares the Lord,<br/>“when I will send men who pour from jars,<br/>and they will pour her out;<br/>they will empty her jars<br/>and smash her jugs.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh,<br/>as the house of Israel was ashamed<br/>when they trusted in Bethel.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>14</b>“How can you say, ‘We are warriors,<br/>men valiant in battle’?</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>Moab will be destroyed and her towns invaded;<br/>her finest young men will go down in the slaughter,”<br/>declares the King, whose name is the Lord Almighty.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>16</b>“The fall of Moab is at hand;<br/>her calamity will come quickly.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>Mourn for her, all who live around her,<br/>all who know her fame;<br/>say, ‘How broken is the mighty scepter,<br/>how broken the glorious staff!’</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>“Come down from your glory<br/>and sit on the parched ground,<br/>O inhabitants of the Daughter of Dibon,<br/>for he who destroys Moab<br/>will come up against you<br/>and ruin your fortified cities.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>Stand by the road and watch,<br/>you who live in Aroer.<br/>Ask the man fleeing and the woman escaping,<br/>ask them, ‘What has happened?’</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>Moab is disgraced, for she is shattered.<br/>Wail and cry out!<br/>Announce by the Arnon<br/>that Moab is destroyed.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>21</b>Judgment has come to the plateau—<br/>to Holon, Jahzah and Mephaath,</span></p><p><span><b>22</b>to Dibon, Nebo and Beth Diblathaim,</span></p><p><span><b>23</b>to Kiriathaim, Beth Gamul and Beth Meon,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>24</b>to Kerioth and Bozrah—<br/>to all the towns of Moab, far and near.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>25</b>Moab's horn is cut off;<br/>her arm is broken,”<br/>declares the Lord.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>26</b>“Make her drunk,<br/>for she has defied the Lord.<br/>Let Moab wallow in her vomit;<br/>let her be an object of ridicule.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>27</b>Was not Israel the object of your ridicule?<br/>Was she caught among thieves,<br/>that you shake your head in scorn<br/>whenever you speak of her?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>28</b>Abandon your towns and dwell among the rocks,<br/>you who live in Moab.<br/>Be like a dove that makes its nest<br/>at the mouth of a cave.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>29</b>“We have heard of Moab's pride—<br/>her overweening pride and conceit,<br/>her pride and arrogance<br/>and the haughtiness of her heart.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>30</b>I know her insolence but it is futile,”<br/>declares the Lord,<br/>“and her boasts accomplish nothing.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>31</b>Therefore I wail over Moab,<br/>for all Moab I cry out,<br/>I moan for the men of Kir Hareseth.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>32</b>I weep for you, as Jazer weeps,<br/>O vines of Sibmah.<br/>Your branches spread as far as the sea;<br/>they reached as far as the sea of Jazer.<br/>The destroyer has fallen<br/>on your ripened fruit and grapes.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>33</b>Joy and gladness are gone<br/>from the orchards and fields of Moab.<br/>I have stopped the flow of wine from the presses;<br/>no one treads them with shouts of joy.<br/>Although there are shouts,<br/>they are not shouts of joy.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>34</b>“The sound of their cry rises<br/>from Heshbon to Elealeh and Jahaz,<br/>from Zoar as far as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah,<br/>for even the waters of Nimrim are dried up.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>35</b>In Moab I will put an end<br/>to those who make offerings on the high places<br/>and burn incense to their gods,”<br/>declares the Lord.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>36</b>“So my heart laments for Moab like a flute;<br/>it laments like a flute for the men of Kir Hareseth.<br/>The wealth they acquired is gone.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>37</b>Every head is shaved<br/>and every beard cut off;<br/>every hand is slashed<br/>and every waist is covered with sackcloth.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>38</b>On all the roofs in Moab<br/>and in the public squares<br/>there is nothing but mourning,<br/>for I have broken Moab<br/>like a jar that no one wants,”<br/>declares the Lord.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>39</b>“How shattered she is! How they wail!<br/>How Moab turns her back in shame!<br/>Moab has become an object of ridicule,<br/>an object of horror to all those around her.”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>40</b>This is what the Lord says:<br/>“Look! An eagle is swooping down,<br/>spreading its wings over Moab.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>41</b>Kerioth will be captured<br/>and the strongholds taken.<br/>In that day the hearts of Moab's warriors<br/>will be like the heart of a woman in labor.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>42</b>Moab will be destroyed as a nation<br/>because she defied the Lord.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>43</b>Terror and pit and snare await you,<br/>O people of Moab,”<br/>declares the Lord.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>44</b>“Whoever flees from the terror<br/>will fall into a pit,<br/>whoever climbs out of the pit<br/>will be caught in a snare;<br/>for I will bring upon Moab<br/>the year of her punishment,”<br/>declares the Lord.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>45</b>“In the shadow of Heshbon<br/>the fugitives stand helpless,<br/>for a fire has gone out from Heshbon,<br/>a blaze from the midst of Sihon;<br/>it burns the foreheads of Moab,<br/>the skulls of the noisy boasters.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>46</b>Woe to you, O Moab!<br/>The people of Chemosh are destroyed;<br/>your sons are taken into exile<br/>and your daughters into captivity.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>47</b>“Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab<br/>in days to come,”<br/>declares the Lord.<br/>Here ends the judgment on Moab.</span></p>

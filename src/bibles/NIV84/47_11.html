<h1>2 Corinthians 11</h1><h2>Paul and the False Apostles</h2><p><span><b>1</b>I hope you will put up with a little of my foolishness; but you are already doing that.</span><span><b>2</b>I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him.</span><span><b>3</b>But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.</span><span><b>4</b>For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough.</span><span><b>5</b>But I do not think I am in the least inferior to those “super‑apostles.”</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>I may not be a trained speaker, but I do have knowledge. We have made this perfectly clear to you in every way.</span><span><b>7</b>Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge?</span><span><b>8</b>I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you.</span><span><b>9</b>And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so.</span><span><b>10</b>As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine.</span><span><b>11</b>Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!</span><span><b>12</b>And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about.</span><span><b>13</b>For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ.</span><span><b>14</b>And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.</span></p><p><span><b>15</b>It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve.</span></p><h2>Paul Boasts About His Sufferings</h2><p><span><b>16</b>I repeat: Let no one take me for a fool. But if you do, then receive me just as you would a fool, so that I may do a little boasting.</span><span><b>17</b>In this self‑confident boasting I am not talking as the Lord would, but as a fool.</span><span><b>18</b>Since many are boasting in the way the world does, I too will boast.</span><span><b>19</b>You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise!</span><span><b>20</b>In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or pushes himself forward or slaps you in the face.</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that!<br/>What anyone else dares to boast about–I am speaking as a fool–I also dare to boast about.</span><span><b>22</b>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham's descendants? So am I.</span><span><b>23</b>Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again.</span><span><b>24</b>Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one.</span><span><b>25</b>Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea,</span><span><b>26</b>I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my own countrymen, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false brothers.</span><span><b>27</b>I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked.</span><span><b>28</b>Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches.</span></p><p><span><b>29</b>Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn?</span><span><b>30</b>If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.</span><span><b>31</b>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be praised forever, knows that I am not lying.</span><span><b>32</b>In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me.</span></p><p><span><b>33</b>But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands.</span></p>

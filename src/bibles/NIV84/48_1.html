<h1>Galatians 1</h1><p><span><b>1</b>Paul, an apostle–sent not from men nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead–</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>and all the brothers with me,<br/><br/>To the churches in Galatia:</span><span><b>3</b>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,</span><span><b>4</b>who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span></p><h2>No Other Gospel</h2><p><span><b>6</b>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel–</span><span><b>7</b>which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.</span><span><b>8</b>But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned!</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>Am I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.</span></p><h2>Paul Called by God</h2><p><span><b>11</b>I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up.</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.</span><span><b>13</b>For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.</span><span><b>14</b>I was advancing in Judaism beyond many Jews of my own age and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</span><span><b>15</b>But when God, who set me apart from birth and called me by his grace, was pleased</span><span><b>16</b>to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not consult any man,</span></p><p><span><b>17</b>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went immediately into Arabia and later returned to Damascus.</span><span><b>18</b>Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter and stayed with him fifteen days.</span><span><b>19</b>I saw none of the other apostles–only James, the Lord's brother.</span><span><b>20</b>I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie.</span><span><b>21</b>Later I went to Syria and Cilicia.</span><span><b>22</b>I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.</span><span><b>23</b>They only heard the report: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.”</span></p><p><span><b>24</b>And they praised God because of me.</span></p>

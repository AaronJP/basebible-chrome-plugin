<h1>Matthew 7</h1><h2>Judging Others</h2><p><span><b>1</b>“Do not judge, or you too will be judged.</span></p><p><span><b>2</b>For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.</span><span><b>3</b>“Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?</span><span><b>4</b>How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye?</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>“Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and then turn and tear you to pieces.</span></p><h2>Ask, Seek, Knock</h2><p><span><b>7</b>“Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.</span></p><p><span><b>8</b>For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.</span><span><b>9</b>“Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?</span><span><b>10</b>Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?</span><span><b>11</b>If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.</span></p><h2>The Narrow and Wide Gates</h2><p><span><b>13</b>“Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.</span></p><h2>A Tree and Its Fruit</h2><p><span><b>15</b>“Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.</span><span><b>16</b>By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?</span><span><b>17</b>Likewise every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.</span><span><b>18</b>A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.</span><span><b>19</b>Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</span></p><p><span><b>20</b>Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.</span><span><b>21</b>“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.</span><span><b>22</b>Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?’</span></p><p><span><b>23</b>Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’</span></p><h2>The Wise and Foolish Builders</h2><p><span><b>24</b>“Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.</span><span><b>25</b>The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.</span><span><b>26</b>But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.</span></p><p><span><b>27</b>The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.”</span><span><b>28</b>When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching,</span></p><p><span><b>29</b>because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.</span></p>

<h1>Lamentations 3</h1><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>I am the man who has seen affliction<br/>by the rod of his wrath.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>2</b>He has driven me away and made me walk<br/>in darkness rather than light;</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>indeed, he has turned his hand against me<br/>again and again, all day long.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>4</b>He has made my skin and my flesh grow old<br/>and has broken my bones.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>He has besieged me and surrounded me<br/>with bitterness and hardship.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>He has made me dwell in darkness<br/>like those long dead.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>7</b>He has walled me in so I cannot escape;<br/>he has weighed me down with chains.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>8</b>Even when I call out or cry for help,<br/>he shuts out my prayer.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>He has barred my way with blocks of stone;<br/>he has made my paths crooked.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>10</b>Like a bear lying in wait,<br/>like a lion in hiding,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>11</b>he dragged me from the path and mangled me<br/>and left me without help.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>He drew his bow<br/>and made me the target for his arrows.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>13</b>He pierced my heart<br/>with arrows from his quiver.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>14</b>I became the laughingstock of all my people;<br/>they mock me in song all day long.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>He has filled me with bitter herbs<br/>and sated me with gall.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>16</b>He has broken my teeth with gravel;<br/>he has trampled me in the dust.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>17</b>I have been deprived of peace;<br/>I have forgotten what prosperity is.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>So I say, “My splendor is gone<br/>and all that I had hoped from the Lord.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>19</b>I remember my affliction and my wandering,<br/>the bitterness and the gall.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>20</b>I well remember them,<br/>and my soul is downcast within me.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>21</b>Yet this I call to mind<br/>and therefore I have hope:</span></p><p/><p><span><b>22</b>Because of the Lord's great love we are not consumed,<br/>for his compassions never fail.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>23</b>They are new every morning;<br/>great is your faithfulness.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>24</b>I say to myself, “The Lord is my portion;<br/>therefore I will wait for him.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>25</b>The Lord is good to those whose hope is in him,<br/>to the one who seeks him;</span></p><p/><p><span><b>26</b>it is good to wait quietly<br/>for the salvation of the Lord.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>27</b>It is good for a man to bear the yoke<br/>while he is young.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>28</b>Let him sit alone in silence,<br/>for the Lord has laid it on him.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>29</b>Let him bury his face in the dust—<br/>there may yet be hope.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>30</b>Let him offer his cheek to one who would strike him,<br/>and let him be filled with disgrace.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>31</b>For men are not cast off<br/>by the Lord forever.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>32</b>Though he brings grief, he will show compassion,<br/>so great is his unfailing love.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>33</b>For he does not willingly bring affliction<br/>or grief to the children of men.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>34</b>To crush underfoot<br/>all prisoners in the land,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>35</b>to deny a man his rights<br/>before the Most High,</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>36</b>to deprive a man of justice—<br/>would not the Lord see such things?</span></p><p/><p><span><b>37</b>Who can speak and have it happen<br/>if the Lord has not decreed it?</span></p><p/><p><span><b>38</b>Is it not from the mouth of the Most High<br/>that both calamities and good things come?</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>39</b>Why should any living man complain<br/>when punished for his sins?</span></p><p/><p><span><b>40</b>Let us examine our ways and test them,<br/>and let us return to the Lord.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>41</b>Let us lift up our hearts and our hands<br/>to God in heaven, and say:</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>42</b>“We have sinned and rebelled<br/>and you have not forgiven.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>43</b>“You have covered yourself with anger and pursued us;<br/>you have slain without pity.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>44</b>You have covered yourself with a cloud<br/>so that no prayer can get through.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>45</b>You have made us scum and refuse<br/>among the nations.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>46</b>“All our enemies have opened their mouths<br/>wide against us.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>47</b>We have suffered terror and pitfalls,<br/>ruin and destruction.”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>48</b>Streams of tears flow from my eyes<br/>because my people are destroyed.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>49</b>My eyes will flow unceasingly,<br/>without relief,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>50</b>until the Lord looks down<br/>from heaven and sees.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>51</b>What I see brings grief to my soul<br/>because of all the women of my city.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>52</b>Those who were my enemies without cause<br/>hunted me like a bird.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>53</b>They tried to end my life in a pit<br/>and threw stones at me;</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>54</b>the waters closed over my head,<br/>and I thought I was about to be cut off.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>55</b>I called on your name, O Lord,<br/>from the depths of the pit.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>56</b>You heard my plea: “Do not close your ears<br/>to my cry for relief.”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>57</b>You came near when I called you,<br/>and you said, “Do not fear.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>58</b>O Lord, you took up my case;<br/>you redeemed my life.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>59</b>You have seen, O Lord, the wrong done to me.<br/>Uphold my cause!</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>60</b>You have seen the depth of their vengeance,<br/>all their plots against me.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>61</b>O Lord, you have heard their insults,<br/>all their plots against me—</span></p><p/><p><span><b>62</b>what my enemies whisper and mutter<br/>against me all day long.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>63</b>Look at them! Sitting or standing,<br/>they mock me in their songs.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>64</b>Pay them back what they deserve, O Lord,<br/>for what their hands have done.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>65</b>Put a veil over their hearts,<br/>and may your curse be on them!</span></p><p/><p><span><b>66</b>Pursue them in anger and destroy them<br/>from under the heavens of the Lord.</span></p>

<h1>Psalm 106</h1><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Praise the Lord.<br/><br/>Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;<br/>his love endures forever.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>2</b>Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the Lord<br/>or fully declare his praise?</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>Blessed are they who maintain justice,<br/>who constantly do what is right.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>4</b>Remember me, O Lord, when you show favor to your people,<br/>come to my aid when you save them,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones,<br/>that I may share in the joy of your nation<br/>and join your inheritance in giving praise.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>6</b>We have sinned, even as our fathers did;<br/>we have done wrong and acted wickedly.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>When our fathers were in Egypt,<br/>they gave no thought to your miracles;<br/>they did not remember your many kindnesses,<br/>and they rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>8</b>Yet he saved them for his name's sake,<br/>to make his mighty power known.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>9</b>He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up;<br/>he led them through the depths as through a desert.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>10</b>He saved them from the hand of the foe;<br/>from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>11</b>The waters covered their adversaries;<br/>not one of them survived.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>Then they believed his promises<br/>and sang his praise.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>13</b>But they soon forgot what he had done<br/>and did not wait for his counsel.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>14</b>In the desert they gave in to their craving;<br/>in the wasteland they put God to the test.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>So he gave them what they asked for,<br/>but sent a wasting disease upon them.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>16</b>In the camp they grew envious of Moses<br/>and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the Lord.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>17</b>The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan;<br/>it buried the company of Abiram.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>Fire blazed among their followers;<br/>a flame consumed the wicked.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>19</b>At Horeb they made a calf<br/>and worshiped an idol cast from metal.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>20</b>They exchanged their Glory<br/>for an image of a bull, which eats grass.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>21</b>They forgot the God who saved them,<br/>who had done great things in Egypt,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>22</b>miracles in the land of Ham<br/>and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>23</b>So he said he would destroy them—<br/>had not Moses, his chosen one,<br/>stood in the breach before him<br/>to keep his wrath from destroying them.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>24</b>Then they despised the pleasant land;<br/>they did not believe his promise.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>25</b>They grumbled in their tents<br/>and did not obey the Lord.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>26</b>So he swore to them with uplifted hand<br/>that he would make them fall in the desert,</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>27</b>make their descendants fall among the nations<br/>and scatter them throughout the lands.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>28</b>They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor<br/>and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods;</span></p><p/><p><span><b>29</b>they provoked the Lord to anger by their wicked deeds,<br/>and a plague broke out among them.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>30</b>But Phinehas stood up and intervened,<br/>and the plague was checked.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>31</b>This was credited to him as righteousness<br/>for endless generations to come.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>32</b>By the waters of Meribah they angered the Lord,<br/>and trouble came to Moses because of them;</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>33</b>for they rebelled against the Spirit of God,<br/>and rash words came from Moses' lips.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>34</b>They did not destroy the peoples<br/>as the Lord had commanded them,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>35</b>but they mingled with the nations<br/>and adopted their customs.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>36</b>They worshiped their idols,<br/>which became a snare to them.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>37</b>They sacrificed their sons<br/>and their daughters to demons.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>38</b>They shed innocent blood,<br/>the blood of their sons and daughters,<br/>whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan,<br/>and the land was desecrated by their blood.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>39</b>They defiled themselves by what they did;<br/>by their deeds they prostituted themselves.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>40</b>Therefore the Lord was angry with his people<br/>and abhorred his inheritance.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>41</b>He handed them over to the nations,<br/>and their foes ruled over them.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>42</b>Their enemies oppressed them<br/>and subjected them to their power.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>43</b>Many times he delivered them,<br/>but they were bent on rebellion<br/>and they wasted away in their sin.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>44</b>But he took note of their distress<br/>when he heard their cry;</span></p><p/><p><span><b>45</b>for their sake he remembered his covenant<br/>and out of his great love he relented.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>46</b>He caused them to be pitied<br/>by all who held them captive.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>47</b>Save us, O Lord our God,<br/>and gather us from the nations,<br/>that we may give thanks to your holy name<br/>and glory in your praise.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>48</b>Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,<br/>from everlasting to everlasting.<br/>Let all the people say, “Amen!”<br/><br/>Praise the Lord.</span></p>

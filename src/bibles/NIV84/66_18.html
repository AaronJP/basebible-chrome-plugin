<h1>Revelation 18</h1><p><span><b>1</b>After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>With a mighty voice he shouted:<br/>“Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great!<br/>She has become a home for demons<br/>and a haunt for every evil spirit,<br/>a haunt for every unclean and detestable bird.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>For all the nations have drunk<br/>the maddening wine of her adulteries.<br/>The kings of the earth committed adultery with her,<br/>and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>Then I heard another voice from heaven say:<br/>“Come out of her, my people,<br/>so that you will not share in her sins,<br/>so that you will not receive any of her plagues;</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>for her sins are piled up to heaven,<br/>and God has remembered her crimes.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>Give back to her as she has given;<br/>pay her back double for what she has done.<br/>Mix her a double portion from her own cup.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>Give her as much torture and grief<br/>as the glory and luxury she gave herself.<br/>In her heart she boasts,<br/>‘I sit as queen; I am not a widow,<br/>and I will never mourn.’</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her:<br/>death, mourning and famine.<br/>She will be consumed by fire,<br/>for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.</span><span><b>9</b>“When the kings of the earth who committed adultery with her and shared her luxury see the smoke of her burning, they will weep and mourn over her.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>Terrified at her torment, they will stand far off and cry:<br/>“ ‘Woe! Woe, O great city,<br/>O Babylon, city of power!<br/>In one hour your doom has come!’</span><span><b>11</b>“The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargoes any more–</span><span><b>12</b>cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet cloth; every sort of citron wood, and articles of every kind made of ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron and marble;</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, of wine and olive oil, of fine flour and wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and carriages; and bodies and souls of men.</span><span><b>14</b>“They will say, ‘The fruit you longed for is gone from you. All your riches and splendor have vanished, never to be recovered.’</span><span><b>15</b>The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand far off, terrified at her torment. They will weep and mourn</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>and cry out:<br/>“ ‘Woe! Woe, O great city,<br/>dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet,<br/>and glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls!</span></p><p><span><b>17</b>In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin!’<br/>“Every sea captain, and all who travel by ship, the sailors, and all who earn their living from the sea, will stand far off.</span><span><b>18</b>When they see the smoke of her burning, they will exclaim, ‘Was there ever a city like this great city?’</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>They will throw dust on their heads, and with weeping and mourning cry out:<br/>“ ‘Woe! Woe, O great city,<br/>where all who had ships on the sea<br/>became rich through her wealth!<br/>In one hour she has been brought to ruin!</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>Rejoice over her, O heaven!<br/>Rejoice, saints and apostles and prophets!<br/>God has judged her for the way she treated you.’ ”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>21</b>Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea, and said:<br/>“With such violence<br/>the great city of Babylon will be thrown down,<br/>never to be found again.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>22</b>The music of harpists and musicians, flute players and trumpeters,<br/>will never be heard in you again.<br/>No workman of any trade<br/>will ever be found in you again.<br/>The sound of a millstone<br/>will never be heard in you again.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>23</b>The light of a lamp will never shine in you again.<br/>The voice of bridegroom and bride<br/>will never be heard in you again.<br/>Your merchants were the world's great men.<br/>By your magic spell all the nations were led astray.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>24</b>In her was found the blood of prophets and of the saints,<br/>and of all who have been killed on the earth.”</span></p>

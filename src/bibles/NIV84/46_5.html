<h1>1 Corinthians 5</h1><h2>Expel the Immoral Brother!</h2><p><span><b>1</b>It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that does not occur even among pagans: A man has his father's wife.</span><span><b>2</b>And you are proud! Shouldn't you rather have been filled with grief and have put out of your fellowship the man who did this?</span><span><b>3</b>Even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit. And I have already passed judgment on the one who did this, just as if I were present.</span><span><b>4</b>When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present,</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>hand this man over to Satan, so that the sinful nature may be destroyed and his spirit saved on the day of the Lord.</span><span><b>6</b>Your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little yeast works through the whole batch of dough?</span><span><b>7</b>Get rid of the old yeast that you may be a new batch without yeast–as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.</span></p><p><span><b>8</b>Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with bread without yeast, the bread of sincerity and truth.</span><span><b>9</b>I have written you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people–</span><span><b>10</b>not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world.</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>But now I am writing you that you must not associate with anyone who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a slanderer, a drunkard or a swindler. With such a man do not even eat.</span><span><b>12</b>What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside?</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>God will judge those outside. “Expel the wicked man from among you.”</span></p>

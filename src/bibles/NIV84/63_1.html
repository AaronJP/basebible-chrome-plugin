<h1>2 John 1</h1><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>The elder,<br/><br/>To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth–and not I only, but also all who know the truth–</span></p><p/><p><span><b>2</b>because of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever:</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, will be with us in truth and love.</span><span><b>4</b>It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us.</span><span><b>5</b>And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one another.</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love.</span><span><b>7</b>Many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.</span><span><b>8</b>Watch out that you do not lose what you have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully.</span><span><b>9</b>Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.</span><span><b>10</b>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take him into your house or welcome him.</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>Anyone who welcomes him shares in his wicked work.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>12</b>I have much to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.</span><span><b>13</b>The children of your chosen sister send their greetings.</span></p>

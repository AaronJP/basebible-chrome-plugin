<h1>Jeremiah 2</h1><h2>Israel Forsakes God</h2><p><span><b>1</b>The word of the Lord came to me:</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>“Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem:<br/>“ ‘I remember the devotion of your youth,<br/>how as a bride you loved me<br/>and followed me through the desert,<br/>through a land not sown.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>Israel was holy to the Lord,<br/>the firstfruits of his harvest;<br/>all who devoured her were held guilty,<br/>and disaster overtook them,’ ”<br/>declares the Lord.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>4</b>Hear the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob,<br/>all you clans of the house of Israel.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>This is what the Lord says:<br/>“What fault did your fathers find in me,<br/>that they strayed so far from me?<br/>They followed worthless idols<br/>and became worthless themselves.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>They did not ask, ‘Where is the Lord,<br/>who brought us up out of Egypt<br/>and led us through the barren wilderness,<br/>through a land of deserts and rifts,<br/>a land of drought and darkness,<br/>a land where no one travels and no one lives?’</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>I brought you into a fertile land<br/>to eat its fruit and rich produce.<br/>But you came and defiled my land<br/>and made my inheritance detestable.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>The priests did not ask,<br/>‘Where is the Lord?’<br/>Those who deal with the law did not know me;<br/>the leaders rebelled against me.<br/>The prophets prophesied by Baal,<br/>following worthless idols.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>“Therefore I bring charges against you again,”<br/>declares the Lord.<br/>“And I will bring charges against your children's children.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>Cross over to the coasts of Kittim and look,<br/>send to Kedar and observe closely;<br/>see if there has ever been anything like this:</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>Has a nation ever changed its gods?<br/>(Yet they are not gods at all.)<br/>But my people have exchanged their Glory<br/>for worthless idols.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>Be appalled at this, O heavens,<br/>and shudder with great horror,”<br/>declares the Lord.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>“My people have committed two sins:<br/>They have forsaken me,<br/>the spring of living water,<br/>and have dug their own cisterns,<br/>broken cisterns that cannot hold water.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>14</b>Is Israel a servant, a slave by birth?<br/>Why then has he become plunder?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>Lions have roared;<br/>they have growled at him.<br/>They have laid waste his land;<br/>his towns are burned and deserted.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>16</b>Also, the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes<br/>have shaved the crown of your head.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>Have you not brought this on yourselves<br/>by forsaking the Lord your God<br/>when he led you in the way?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>Now why go to Egypt<br/>to drink water from the Shihor?<br/>And why go to Assyria<br/>to drink water from the River?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>Your wickedness will punish you;<br/>your backsliding will rebuke you.<br/>Consider then and realize<br/>how evil and bitter it is for you<br/>when you forsake the Lord your God<br/>and have no awe of me,”<br/>declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>“Long ago you broke off your yoke<br/>and tore off your bonds;<br/>you said, ‘I will not serve you!’<br/>Indeed, on every high hill<br/>and under every spreading tree<br/>you lay down as a prostitute.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>21</b>I had planted you like a choice vine<br/>of sound and reliable stock.<br/>How then did you turn against me<br/>into a corrupt, wild vine?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>22</b>Although you wash yourself with soda<br/>and use an abundance of soap,<br/>the stain of your guilt is still before me,”<br/>declares the Sovereign Lord.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>23</b>“How can you say, ‘I am not defiled;<br/>I have not run after the Baals’?<br/>See how you behaved in the valley;<br/>consider what you have done.<br/>You are a swift she-camel<br/>running here and there,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>24</b>a wild donkey accustomed to the desert,<br/>sniffing the wind in her craving—<br/>in her heat who can restrain her?<br/>Any males that pursue her need not tire themselves;<br/>at mating time they will find her.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>25</b>Do not run until your feet are bare<br/>and your throat is dry.<br/>But you said, ‘It's no use!<br/>I love foreign gods,<br/>and I must go after them.’</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>26</b>“As a thief is disgraced when he is caught,<br/>so the house of Israel is disgraced—<br/>they, their kings and their officials,<br/>their priests and their prophets.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>27</b>They say to wood, ‘You are my father,’<br/>and to stone, ‘You gave me birth.’<br/>They have turned their backs to me<br/>and not their faces;<br/>yet when they are in trouble, they say,<br/>‘Come and save us!’</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>28</b>Where then are the gods you made for yourselves?<br/>Let them come if they can save you<br/>when you are in trouble!<br/>For you have as many gods<br/>as you have towns, O Judah.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>29</b>“Why do you bring charges against me?<br/>You have all rebelled against me,”<br/>declares the Lord.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>30</b>“In vain I punished your people;<br/>they did not respond to correction.<br/>Your sword has devoured your prophets<br/>like a ravening lion.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>31</b>“You of this generation, consider the word of the Lord:<br/>“Have I been a desert to Israel<br/>or a land of great darkness?<br/>Why do my people say, ‘We are free to roam;<br/>we will come to you no more’?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>32</b>Does a maiden forget her jewelry,<br/>a bride her wedding ornaments?<br/>Yet my people have forgotten me,<br/>days without number.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>33</b>How skilled you are at pursuing love!<br/>Even the worst of women can learn from your ways.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>34</b>On your clothes men find<br/>the lifeblood of the innocent poor,<br/>though you did not catch them breaking in.<br/>Yet in spite of all this</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>35</b>you say, ‘I am innocent;<br/>he is not angry with me.’<br/>But I will pass judgment on you<br/>because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>36</b>Why do you go about so much,<br/>changing your ways?<br/>You will be disappointed by Egypt<br/>as you were by Assyria.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>37</b>You will also leave that place<br/>with your hands on your head,<br/>for the Lord has rejected those you trust;<br/>you will not be helped by them.</span></p>

<h1>Mark 1</h1><h2>John the Baptist Prepares the Way</h2><p/><p><span><b>1</b>The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>It is written in Isaiah the prophet:<br/>“I will send my messenger ahead of you,<br/>who will prepare your way”–</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>“a voice of one calling in the desert,<br/>‘Prepare the way for the Lord,<br/>make straight paths for him.’ ”</span><span><b>4</b>And so John came, baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</span><span><b>5</b>The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</span><span><b>6</b>John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</span><span><b>7</b>And this was his message: “After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.</span></p><p><span><b>8</b>I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”</span></p><h2>The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus</h2><p><span><b>9</b>At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</span><span><b>10</b>As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.”</span><span><b>12</b>At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert,</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>and he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.</span></p><h2>The Calling of the First Disciples</h2><p><span><b>14</b>After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.</span></p><p><span><b>15</b>“The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!”</span><span><b>16</b>As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.</span><span><b>17</b>“Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.”</span></p><p><span><b>18</b>At once they left their nets and followed him.</span><span><b>19</b>When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.</span></p><p><span><b>20</b>Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.</span></p><h2>Jesus Drives Out an Evil Spirit</h2><p><span><b>21</b>They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.</span><span><b>22</b>The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.</span><span><b>23</b>Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out,</span></p><p><span><b>24</b>“What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are–the Holy One of God!”</span><span><b>25</b>“Be quiet!” said Jesus sternly. “Come out of him!”</span></p><p><span><b>26</b>The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.</span><span><b>27</b>The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, “What is this? A new teaching–and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him.”</span></p><p><span><b>28</b>News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.</span></p><h2>Jesus Heals Many</h2><p><span><b>29</b>As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.</span><span><b>30</b>Simon's mother‑in‑law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.</span></p><p><span><b>31</b>So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.</span><span><b>32</b>That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon‑possessed.</span><span><b>33</b>The whole town gathered at the door,</span></p><p><span><b>34</b>and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.</span></p><h2>Jesus Prays in a Solitary Place</h2><p><span><b>35</b>Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.</span><span><b>36</b>Simon and his companions went to look for him,</span></p><p><span><b>37</b>and when they found him, they exclaimed: “Everyone is looking for you!”</span><span><b>38</b>Jesus replied, “Let us go somewhere else–to the nearby villages–so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.”</span></p><p><span><b>39</b>So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.</span></p><h2>A Man With Leprosy</h2><p/><p><span><b>40</b>A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, “If you are willing, you can make me clean.”</span><span><b>41</b>Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!”</span></p><p><span><b>42</b>Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured.</span><span><b>43</b>Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:</span><span><b>44</b>“See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”</span></p><p><span><b>45</b>Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.</span></p>

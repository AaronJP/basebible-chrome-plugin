But at the end of these seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute:</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>“Take up a harp, walk through the city,<br/>O prostitute forgotten;<br/>play the harp well, sing many a song,<br/>so that you will be remembered.”</span><span><b>17</b>At the end of seventy years, the Lord will deal with Tyre. She will return to her hire as a prostitute and will ply her trade with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.</span></p><p><span><b>18</b>Yet her profit and her earnings will be set apart for the Lord; they will not be stored up or hoarded. Her profits will go to those who live before the Lord, for abundant food and fine clothes.</span></p>

<h1>Job 35</h1><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Then Elihu said:</span></p><p/><p><span><b>2</b>“Do you think this is just?<br/>You say, ‘I will be cleared by God.’</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>Yet you ask him, ‘What profit is it to me,<br/>and what do I gain by not sinning?’</span></p><p/><p><span><b>4</b>“I would like to reply to you<br/>and to your friends with you.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>Look up at the heavens and see;<br/>gaze at the clouds so high above you.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>6</b>If you sin, how does that affect him?<br/>If your sins are many, what does that do to him?</span></p><p/><p><span><b>7</b>If you are righteous, what do you give to him,<br/>or what does he receive from your hand?</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself,<br/>and your righteousness only the sons of men.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>9</b>“Men cry out under a load of oppression;<br/>they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>10</b>But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker,<br/>who gives songs in the night,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>11</b>who teaches more to us than to the beasts of the earth<br/>and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?’</span></p><p/><p><span><b>12</b>He does not answer when men cry out<br/>because of the arrogance of the wicked.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>13</b>Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea;<br/>the Almighty pays no attention to it.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>How much less, then, will he listen<br/>when you say that you do not see him,<br/>that your case is before him<br/>and you must wait for him,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>15</b>and further, that his anger never punishes<br/>and he does not take the least notice of wickedness.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>16</b>So Job opens his mouth with empty talk;<br/>without knowledge he multiplies words.”</span></p>

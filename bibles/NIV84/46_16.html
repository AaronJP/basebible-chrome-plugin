<h1>1 Corinthians 16</h1><h2>The Collection for God's People</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Now about the collection for God's people: Do what I told the Galatian churches to do.</span><span><b>2</b>On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with his income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will have to be made.</span><span><b>3</b>Then, when I arrive, I will give letters of introduction to the men you approve and send them with your gift to Jerusalem.</span></p><p><span><b>4</b>If it seems advisable for me to go also, they will accompany me.</span></p><h2>Personal Requests</h2><p><span><b>5</b>After I go through Macedonia, I will come to you–for I will be going through Macedonia.</span><span><b>6</b>Perhaps I will stay with you awhile, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey, wherever I go.</span><span><b>7</b>I do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.</span><span><b>8</b>But I will stay on at Ephesus until Pentecost,</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>because a great door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many who oppose me.</span><span><b>10</b>If Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is carrying on the work of the Lord, just as I am.</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>No one, then, should refuse to accept him. Send him on his way in peace so that he may return to me. I am expecting him along with the brothers.</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was quite unwilling to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity.</span><span><b>13</b>Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be men of courage; be strong.</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>Do everything in love.</span><span><b>15</b>You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints. I urge you, brothers,</span><span><b>16</b>to submit to such as these and to everyone who joins in the work, and labors at it.</span><span><b>17</b>I was glad when Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you.</span></p><p><span><b>18</b>For they refreshed my spirit and yours also. Such men deserve recognition.</span></p><h2>Final Greetings</h2><p><span><b>19</b>The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house.</span></p><p><span><b>20</b>All the brothers here send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand.</span></p><p><span><b>22</b>If anyone does not love the Lord–a curse be on him. Come, O Lord!</span></p><p><span><b>23</b>The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.</span><span><b>24</b>My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.</span></p>

<h1>Psalm 133</h1><h2>A song of ascents. Of David.</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>How good and pleasant it is<br/>when brothers live together in unity!</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>It is like precious oil poured on the head,<br/>running down on the beard,<br/>running down on Aaron's beard,<br/>down upon the collar of his robes.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>It is as if the dew of Hermon<br/>were falling on Mount Zion.<br/>For there the Lord bestows his blessing,<br/>even life forevermore.</span></p>

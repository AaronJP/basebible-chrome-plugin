<h1>Haggai 2</h1><h2>The Promised Glory of the New House</h2><p><span><b>1</b>On the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai:</span><span><b>2</b>“Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people. Ask them,</span><span><b>3</b>‘Who of you is left who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Does it not seem to you like nothing?</span><span><b>4</b>But now be strong, O Zerubbabel,’ declares the Lord. ‘Be strong, O Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,’ declares the Lord, ‘and work. For I am with you,’ declares the Lord Almighty.</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>‘This is what I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt. And my Spirit remains among you. Do not fear.’</span><span><b>6</b>“This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘In a little while I will once more shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land.</span><span><b>7</b>I will shake all nations, and the desired of all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory,’ says the Lord Almighty.</span><span><b>8</b>‘The silver is mine and the gold is mine,’ declares the Lord Almighty.</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>‘The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house,’ says the Lord Almighty. ‘And in this place I will grant peace,’ declares the Lord Almighty.”</span></p><h2>Blessings for a Defiled People</h2><p><span><b>10</b>On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Haggai:</span><span><b>11</b>“This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘Ask the priests what the law says:</span></p><p/><p><span><b>12</b>If a person carries consecrated meat in the fold of his garment, and that fold touches some bread or stew, some wine, oil or other food, does it become consecrated?’ ”<br/>The priests answered, “No.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>13</b>Then Haggai said, “If a person defiled by contact with a dead body touches one of these things, does it become defiled?”<br/>“Yes,” the priests replied, “it becomes defiled.”</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>Then Haggai said, “ ‘So it is with this people and this nation in my sight,’ declares the Lord. ‘Whatever they do and whatever they offer there is defiled.</span><span><b>15</b>” ‘Now give careful thought to this from this day on—consider how things were before one stone was laid on another in the Lord's temple.</span><span><b>16</b>When anyone came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When anyone went to a wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were only twenty.</span><span><b>17</b>I struck all the work of your hands with blight, mildew and hail, yet you did not turn to me,’ declares the Lord.</span><span><b>18</b>‘From this day on, from this twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, give careful thought to the day when the foundation of the Lord's temple was laid. Give careful thought:</span></p><p/><p><span><b>19</b>Is there yet any seed left in the barn? Until now, the vine and the fig tree, the pomegranate and the olive tree have not borne fruit.<br/>“ ‘From this day on I will bless you.’ ”</span></p><h2>Zerubbabel the Lord's Signet Ring</h2><p><span><b>20</b>The word of the Lord came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth day of the month:</span><span><b>21</b>“Tell Zerubbabel governor of Judah that I will shake the heavens and the earth.</span></p><p><span><b>22</b>I will overturn royal thrones and shatter the power of the foreign kingdoms. I will overthrow chariots and their drivers; horses and their riders will fall, each by the sword of his brother.</span><span><b>23</b>” ‘On that day,’ declares the Lord Almighty, ‘I will take you, my servant Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,’ declares the Lord, ‘and I will make you like my signet ring, for I have chosen you,’ declares the Lord Almighty.”</span></p>

<h1>Genesis 25</h1><h2>The Death of Abraham</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah.</span><span><b>2</b>She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah.</span><span><b>3</b>Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan; the descendants of Dedan were the Asshurites, the Letushites and the Leummites.</span></p><p><span><b>4</b>The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.</span><span><b>5</b>Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>But while he was still living, he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east.</span><span><b>7</b>Altogether, Abraham lived a hundred and seventy-five years.</span><span><b>8</b>Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man and full of years; and he was gathered to his people.</span><span><b>9</b>His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite,</span><span><b>10</b>the field Abraham had bought from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah.</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>After Abraham's death, God blessed his son Isaac, who then lived near Beer Lahai Roi.</span></p><h2>Ishmael's Sons</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>This is the account of Abraham's son Ishmael, whom Sarah's maidservant, Hagar the Egyptian, bore to Abraham.</span><span><b>13</b>These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, listed in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,</span><span><b>14</b>Mishma, Dumah, Massa,</span><span><b>15</b>Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah.</span><span><b>16</b>These were the sons of Ishmael, and these are the names of the twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements and camps.</span><span><b>17</b>Altogether, Ishmael lived a hundred and thirty-seven years. He breathed his last and died, and he was gathered to his people.</span></p><p><span><b>18</b>His descendants settled in the area from Havilah to Shur, near the border of Egypt, as you go toward Asshur. And they lived in hostility toward all their brothers.</span></p><h2>Jacob and Esau</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>This is the account of Abraham's son Isaac.<br/><br/>Abraham became the father of Isaac,</span></p><p><span><b>20</b>and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram and sister of Laban the Aramean.</span><span><b>21</b>Isaac prayed to the Lord on behalf of his wife, because she was barren. The Lord answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant.</span></p><p><span><b>22</b>The babies jostled each other within her, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” So she went to inquire of the Lord.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>23</b>The Lord said to her,<br/>“Two nations are in your womb,<br/>and two peoples from within you will be separated;<br/>one people will be stronger than the other,<br/>and the older will serve the younger.”</span><span><b>24</b>When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.</span><span><b>25</b>The first to come out was red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment; so they named him Esau.</span></p><p><span><b>26</b>After this, his brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau's heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them.</span><span><b>27</b>The boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country, while Jacob was a quiet man, staying among the tents.</span></p><p><span><b>28</b>Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.</span><span><b>29</b>Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished.</span></p><p><span><b>30</b>He said to Jacob, “Quick, let me have some of that red stew! I'm famished!” (That is why he was also called Edom.)</span></p><p><span><b>31</b>Jacob replied, “First sell me your birthright.”</span></p><p><span><b>32</b>“Look, I am about to die,” Esau said. “What good is the birthright to me?”</span></p><p><span><b>33</b>But Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>34</b>Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left.<br/>So Esau despised his birthright.</span></p>

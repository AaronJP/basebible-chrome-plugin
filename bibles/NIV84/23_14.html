<h1>Isaiah 14</h1><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>The Lord will have compassion on Jacob;<br/>once again he will choose Israel<br/>and will settle them in their own land.<br/>Aliens will join them<br/>and unite with the house of Jacob.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>Nations will take them<br/>and bring them to their own place.<br/>And the house of Israel will possess the nations<br/>as menservants and maidservants in the Lord's land.<br/>They will make captives of their captors<br/>and rule over their oppressors.</span><span><b>3</b>On the day the Lord gives you relief from suffering and turmoil and cruel bondage,</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon:<br/>How the oppressor has come to an end!<br/>How his fury has ended!</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>The Lord has broken the rod of the wicked,<br/>the scepter of the rulers,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>which in anger struck down peoples<br/>with unceasing blows,<br/>and in fury subdued nations<br/>with relentless aggression.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>7</b>All the lands are at rest and at peace;<br/>they break into singing.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>Even the pine trees and the cedars of Lebanon<br/>exult over you and say,<br/>“Now that you have been laid low,<br/>no woodsman comes to cut us down.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>The grave below is all astir<br/>to meet you at your coming;<br/>it rouses the spirits of the departed to greet you—<br/>all those who were leaders in the world;<br/>it makes them rise from their thrones—<br/>all those who were kings over the nations.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>They will all respond,<br/>they will say to you,<br/>“You also have become weak, as we are;<br/>you have become like us.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>All your pomp has been brought down to the grave,<br/>along with the noise of your harps;<br/>maggots are spread out beneath you<br/>and worms cover you.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>How you have fallen from heaven,<br/>O morning star, son of the dawn!<br/>You have been cast down to the earth,<br/>you who once laid low the nations!</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>You said in your heart,<br/>“I will ascend to heaven;<br/>I will raise my throne<br/>above the stars of God;<br/>I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly,<br/>on the utmost heights of the sacred mountain.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>14</b>I will ascend above the tops of the clouds;<br/>I will make myself like the Most High.”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>But you are brought down to the grave,<br/>to the depths of the pit.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>Those who see you stare at you,<br/>they ponder your fate:<br/>“Is this the man who shook the earth<br/>and made kingdoms tremble,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>the man who made the world a desert,<br/>who overthrew its cities<br/>and would not let his captives go home?”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>18</b>All the kings of the nations lie in state,<br/>each in his own tomb.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>But you are cast out of your tomb<br/>like a rejected branch;<br/>you are covered with the slain,<br/>with those pierced by the sword,<br/>those who descend to the stones of the pit.<br/>Like a corpse trampled underfoot,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>you will not join them in burial,<br/>for you have destroyed your land<br/>and killed your people.<br/><br/>The offspring of the wicked<br/>will never be mentioned again.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>21</b>Prepare a place to slaughter his sons<br/>for the sins of their forefathers;<br/>they are not to rise to inherit the land<br/>and cover the earth with their cities.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>22</b>“I will rise up against them,”<br/>declares the Lord Almighty.<br/>“I will cut off from Babylon her name and survivors,<br/>her offspring and descendants,”<br/>declares the Lord.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>23</b>“I will turn her into a place for owls<br/>and into swampland;<br/>I will sweep her with the broom of destruction,”<br/>declares the Lord Almighty.</span></p><h2>A Prophecy Against Assyria</h2><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>24</b>The Lord Almighty has sworn,<br/>“Surely, as I have planned, so it will be,<br/>and as I have purposed, so it will stand.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>25</b>I will crush the Assyrian in my land;<br/>on my mountains I will trample him down.<br/>His yoke will be taken from my people,<br/>and his burden removed from their shoulders.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>26</b>This is the plan determined for the whole world;<br/>this is the hand stretched out over all nations.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>27</b>For the Lord Almighty has purposed, and who can thwart him?<br/>His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?</span></p><h2>A Prophecy Against the Philistines</h2><p/><p><span><b>28</b>This oracle came in the year King Ahaz died:</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>29</b>Do not rejoice, all you Philistines,<br/>that the rod that struck you is broken;<br/>from the root of that snake will spring up a viper,<br/>its fruit will be a darting, venomous serpent.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>30</b>The poorest of the poor will find pasture,<br/>and the needy will lie down in safety.<br/>But your root I will destroy by famine;<br/>it will slay your survivors.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>31</b>Wail, O gate! Howl, O city!<br/>Melt away, all you Philistines!<br/>A cloud of smoke comes from the north,<br/>and there is not a straggler in its ranks.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>32</b>What answer shall be given<br/>to the envoys of that nation?<br/>“The Lord has established Zion,<br/>and in her his afflicted people will find refuge.”</span></p>

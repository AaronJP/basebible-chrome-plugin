<h1>Psalm 137</h1><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept<br/>when we remembered Zion.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>2</b>There on the poplars<br/>we hung our harps,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>for there our captors asked us for songs,<br/>our tormentors demanded songs of joy;<br/>they said, “Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>4</b>How can we sing the songs of the Lord<br/>while in a foreign land?</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>If I forget you, O Jerusalem,<br/>may my right hand forget<i> its skill</i>.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth<br/>if I do not remember you,<br/>if I do not consider Jerusalem<br/>my highest joy.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>Remember, O Lord, what the Edomites did<br/>on the day Jerusalem fell.<br/>“Tear it down,” they cried,<br/>“tear it down to its foundations!”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction,<br/>happy is he who repays you<br/>for what you have done to us—</span></p><p/><p><span><b>9</b>he who seizes your infants<br/>and dashes them against the rocks.</span></p>

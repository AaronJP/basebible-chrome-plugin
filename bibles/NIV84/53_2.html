<h1>2 Thessalonians 2</h1><h2>The Man of Lawlessness</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers,</span><span><b>2</b>not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by some prophecy, report or letter supposed to have come from us, saying that the day of the Lord has already come.</span><span><b>3</b>Don't let anyone deceive you in any way, for<i> that day will not come</i>until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction.</span></p><p><span><b>4</b>He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God's temple, proclaiming himself to be God.</span><span><b>5</b>Don't you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things?</span><span><b>6</b>And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time.</span><span><b>7</b>For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way.</span><span><b>8</b>And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming.</span><span><b>9</b>The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the work of Satan displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles, signs and wonders,</span><span><b>10</b>and in every sort of evil that deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.</span><span><b>11</b>For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.</span></p><h2>Stand Firm</h2><p><span><b>13</b>But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because from the beginning God chose you to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth.</span><span><b>14</b>He called you to this through our gospel, that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p><p><span><b>15</b>So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the teachings we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter.</span><span><b>16</b>May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope,</span></p><p><span><b>17</b>encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word.</span></p>

<h1>Isaiah 45</h1><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>“This is what the Lord says to his anointed,<br/>to Cyrus, whose right hand I take hold of<br/>to subdue nations before him<br/>and to strip kings of their armor,<br/>to open doors before him<br/>so that gates will not be shut:</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>I will go before you<br/>and will level the mountains;<br/>I will break down gates of bronze<br/>and cut through bars of iron.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>I will give you the treasures of darkness,<br/>riches stored in secret places,<br/>so that you may know that I am the Lord,<br/>the God of Israel, who summons you by name.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>For the sake of Jacob my servant,<br/>of Israel my chosen,<br/>I summon you by name<br/>and bestow on you a title of honor,<br/>though you do not acknowledge me.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>I am the Lord, and there is no other;<br/>apart from me there is no God.<br/>I will strengthen you,<br/>though you have not acknowledged me,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>so that from the rising of the sun<br/>to the place of its setting<br/>men may know there is none besides me.<br/>I am the Lord, and there is no other.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>I form the light and create darkness,<br/>I bring prosperity and create disaster;<br/>I, the Lord, do all these things.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>“You heavens above, rain down righteousness;<br/>let the clouds shower it down.<br/>Let the earth open wide,<br/>let salvation spring up,<br/>let righteousness grow with it;<br/>I, the Lord, have created it.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>“Woe to him who quarrels with his Maker,<br/>to him who is but a potsherd among the potsherds on the ground.<br/>Does the clay say to the potter,<br/>‘What are you making?’<br/>Does your work say,<br/>‘He has no hands’?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>Woe to him who says to his father,<br/>‘What have you begotten?’<br/>or to his mother,<br/>‘What have you brought to birth?’</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>“This is what the Lord says—<br/>the Holy One of Israel, and its Maker:<br/>Concerning things to come,<br/>do you question me about my children,<br/>or give me orders about the work of my hands?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>It is I who made the earth<br/>and created mankind upon it.<br/>My own hands stretched out the heavens;<br/>I marshaled their starry hosts.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>I will raise up Cyrus in my righteousness:<br/>I will make all his ways straight.<br/>He will rebuild my city<br/>and set my exiles free,<br/>but not for a price or reward,<br/>says the Lord Almighty.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>This is what the Lord says:<br/>“The products of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush,<br/>and those tall Sabeans—<br/>they will come over to you<br/>and will be yours;<br/>they will trudge behind you,<br/>coming over to you in chains.<br/>They will bow down before you<br/>and plead with you, saying,<br/>‘Surely God is with you, and there is no other;<br/>there is no other god.’ ”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>15</b>Truly you are a God who hides himself,<br/>O God and Savior of Israel.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>16</b>All the makers of idols will be put to shame and disgraced;<br/>they will go off into disgrace together.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>But Israel will be saved by the Lord<br/>with an everlasting salvation;<br/>you will never be put to shame or disgraced,<br/>to ages everlasting.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>For this is what the Lord says—<br/>he who created the heavens,<br/>he is God;<br/>he who fashioned and made the earth,<br/>he founded it;<br/>he did not create it to be empty,<br/>but formed it to be inhabited—<br/>he says:<br/>“I am the Lord,<br/>and there is no other.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>I have not spoken in secret,<br/>from somewhere in a land of darkness;<br/>I have not said to Jacob's descendants,<br/>‘Seek me in vain.’<br/>I, the Lord, speak the truth;<br/>I declare what is right.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>“Gather together and come;<br/>assemble, you fugitives from the nations.<br/>Ignorant are those who carry about idols of wood,<br/>who pray to gods that cannot save.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>21</b>Declare what is to be, present it—<br/>let them take counsel together.<br/>Who foretold this long ago,<br/>who declared it from the distant past?<br/>Was it not I, the Lord?<br/>And there is no God apart from me,<br/>a righteous God and a Savior;<br/>there is none but me.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>22</b>“Turn to me and be saved,<br/>all you ends of the earth;<br/>for I am God, and there is no other.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>23</b>By myself I have sworn,<br/>my mouth has uttered in all integrity<br/>a word that will not be revoked:<br/>Before me every knee will bow;<br/>by me every tongue will swear.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>24</b>They will say of me, ‘In the Lord alone<br/>are righteousness and strength.’ ”<br/>All who have raged against him<br/>will come to him and be put to shame.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>25</b>But in the Lord all the descendants of Israel<br/>will be found righteous and will exult.</span></p>

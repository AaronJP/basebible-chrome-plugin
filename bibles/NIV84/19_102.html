<h1>Psalm 102</h1><h2>A prayer of an afflicted man. When he is faint and pours out his lament before the Lord.</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Hear my prayer, O Lord;<br/>let my cry for help come to you.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>Do not hide your face from me<br/>when I am in distress.<br/>Turn your ear to me;<br/>when I call, answer me quickly.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>For my days vanish like smoke;<br/>my bones burn like glowing embers.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>4</b>My heart is blighted and withered like grass;<br/>I forget to eat my food.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>Because of my loud groaning<br/>I am reduced to skin and bones.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>6</b>I am like a desert owl,<br/>like an owl among the ruins.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>7</b>I lie awake; I have become<br/>like a bird alone on a roof.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>8</b>All day long my enemies taunt me;<br/>those who rail against me use my name as a curse.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>9</b>For I eat ashes as my food<br/>and mingle my drink with tears</span></p><p/><p><span><b>10</b>because of your great wrath,<br/>for you have taken me up and thrown me aside.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>My days are like the evening shadow;<br/>I wither away like grass.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>12</b>But you, O Lord, sit enthroned forever;<br/>your renown endures through all generations.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>You will arise and have compassion on Zion,<br/>for it is time to show favor to her;<br/>the appointed time has come.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>14</b>For her stones are dear to your servants;<br/>her very dust moves them to pity.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>15</b>The nations will fear the name of the Lord,<br/>all the kings of the earth will revere your glory.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>16</b>For the Lord will rebuild Zion<br/>and appear in his glory.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>He will respond to the prayer of the destitute;<br/>he will not despise their plea.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>18</b>Let this be written for a future generation,<br/>that a people not yet created may praise the Lord:</span></p><p/><p><span><b>19</b>“The Lord looked down from his sanctuary on high,<br/>from heaven he viewed the earth,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>20</b>to hear the groans of the prisoners<br/>and release those condemned to death.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>21</b>So the name of the Lord will be declared in Zion<br/>and his praise in Jerusalem</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>22</b>when the peoples and the kingdoms<br/>assemble to worship the Lord.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>23</b>In the course of my life he broke my strength;<br/>he cut short my days.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>24</b>So I said:<br/>“Do not take me away, O my God, in the midst of my days;<br/>your years go on through all generations.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>25</b>In the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth,<br/>and the heavens are the work of your hands.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>26</b>They will perish, but you remain;<br/>they will all wear out like a garment.<br/>Like clothing you will change them<br/>and they will be discarded.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>27</b>But you remain the same,<br/>and your years will never end.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>28</b>The children of your servants will live in your presence;<br/>their descendants will be established before you.”</span></p>

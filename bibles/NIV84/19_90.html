<h1>Psalm 90</h1><h2>A prayer of Moses the man of God.</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Lord, you have been our dwelling place<br/>throughout all generations.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>Before the mountains were born<br/>or you brought forth the earth and the world,<br/>from everlasting to everlasting you are God.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>You turn men back to dust,<br/>saying, “Return to dust, O sons of men.”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>For a thousand years in your sight<br/>are like a day that has just gone by,<br/>or like a watch in the night.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>You sweep men away in the sleep of death;<br/>they are like the new grass of the morning—</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>though in the morning it springs up new,<br/>by evening it is dry and withered.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>7</b>We are consumed by your anger<br/>and terrified by your indignation.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>8</b>You have set our iniquities before you,<br/>our secret sins in the light of your presence.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>9</b>All our days pass away under your wrath;<br/>we finish our years with a moan.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>The length of our days is seventy years—<br/>or eighty, if we have the strength;<br/>yet their span is but trouble and sorrow,<br/>for they quickly pass, and we fly away.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>11</b>Who knows the power of your anger?<br/>For your wrath is as great as the fear that is due you.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>Teach us to number our days aright,<br/>that we may gain a heart of wisdom.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>13</b>Relent, O Lord! How long will it be?<br/>Have compassion on your servants.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>14</b>Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love,<br/>that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>15</b>Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us,<br/>for as many years as we have seen trouble.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>May your deeds be shown to your servants,<br/>your splendor to their children.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>May the favor of the Lord our God rest upon us;<br/>establish the work of our hands for us—<br/>yes, establish the work of our hands.</span></p>

<h1>Psalm 131</h1><h2>A song of ascents. Of David.</h2><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>My heart is not proud, O Lord,<br/>my eyes are not haughty;<br/>I do not concern myself with great matters<br/>or things too wonderful for me.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>But I have stilled and quieted my soul;<br/>like a weaned child with its mother,<br/>like a weaned child is my soul within me.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>O Israel, put your hope in the Lord<br/>both now and forevermore.</span></p>

Are you repaying me for something I have done? If you are paying me back, I will swiftly and speedily return on your own heads what you have done.</span><span><b>5</b>For you took my silver and my gold and carried off my finest treasures to your temples.</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, that you might send them far from their homeland.</span><span><b>7</b>“See, I am going to rouse them out of the places to which you sold them, and I will return on your own heads what you have done.</span></p><p><span><b>8</b>I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far away.” The Lord has spoken.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>Proclaim this among the nations:<br/>Prepare for war!<br/>Rouse the warriors!<br/>Let all the fighting men draw near and attack.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>Beat your plowshares into swords<br/>and your pruning hooks into spears.<br/>Let the weakling say,<br/>“I am strong!”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>Come quickly, all you nations from every side,<br/>and assemble there.<br/><br/>Bring down your warriors, O Lord!</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>“Let the nations be roused;<br/>let them advance into the Valley of Jehoshaphat,<br/>for there I will sit<br/>to judge all the nations on every side.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>Swing the sickle,<br/>for the harvest is ripe.<br/>Come, trample the grapes,<br/>for the winepress is full<br/>and the vats overflow—<br/>so great is their wickedness!”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>Multitudes, multitudes<br/>in the valley of decision!<br/>For the day of the Lord is near<br/>in the valley of decision.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>15</b>The sun and moon will be darkened,<br/>and the stars no longer shine.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>The Lord will roar from Zion<br/>and thunder from Jerusalem;<br/>the earth and the sky will tremble.<br/>But the Lord will be a refuge for his people,<br/>a stronghold for the people of Israel.</span></p><h2>Blessings for God's People</h2><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>“Then you will know that I, the Lord your God,<br/>dwell in Zion, my holy hill.<br/>Jerusalem will be holy;<br/>never again will foreigners invade her.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>“In that day the mountains will drip new wine,<br/>and the hills will flow with milk;<br/>all the ravines of Judah will run with water.<br/>A fountain will flow out of the Lord's house<br/>and will water the valley of acacias.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>But Egypt will be desolate,<br/>Edom a desert waste,<br/>because of violence done to the people of Judah,<br/>in whose land they shed innocent blood.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>20</b>Judah will be inhabited forever<br/>and Jerusalem through all generations.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>21</b>Their bloodguilt, which I have not pardoned,<br/>I will pardon.”<br/><br/>The Lord dwells in Zion!</span></p>

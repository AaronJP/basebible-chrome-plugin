<h1>Exodus 5</h1><h2>Bricks Without Straw</h2><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the desert.’ ”</span></p><p><span><b>2</b>Pharaoh said, “Who is the Lord, that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the Lord and I will not let Israel go.”</span></p><p><span><b>3</b>Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword.”</span><span><b>4</b>But the king of Egypt said, “Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!”</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>Then Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working.”</span><span><b>6</b>That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and foremen in charge of the people:</span><span><b>7</b>“You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw.</span><span><b>8</b>But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don't reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>Make the work harder for the men so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies.”</span><span><b>10</b>Then the slave drivers and the foremen went out and said to the people, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not give you any more straw.</span><span><b>11</b>Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.’ ”</span><span><b>12</b>So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw.</span><span><b>13</b>The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, “Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw.”</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>The Israelite foremen appointed by Pharaoh's slave drivers were beaten and were asked, “Why didn't you meet your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?”</span><span><b>15</b>Then the Israelite foremen went and appealed to Pharaoh: “Why have you treated your servants this way?</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.”</span><span><b>17</b>Pharaoh said, “Lazy, that's what you are—lazy! That is why you keep saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.’</span></p><p><span><b>18</b>Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks.”</span><span><b>19</b>The Israelite foremen realized they were in trouble when they were told, “You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day.”</span><span><b>20</b>When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them,</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>and they said, “May the Lord look upon you and judge you! You have made us a stench to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.”</span></p><h2>God Promises Deliverance</h2><p><span><b>22</b>Moses returned to the Lord and said, “O Lord, why have you brought trouble upon this people? Is this why you sent me?</span></p><p><span><b>23</b>Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble upon this people, and you have not rescued your people at all.”</span></p>

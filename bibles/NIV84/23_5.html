<h1>Isaiah 5</h1><h2>The Song of the Vineyard</h2><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>I will sing for the one I love<br/>a song about his vineyard:<br/>My loved one had a vineyard<br/>on a fertile hillside.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>He dug it up and cleared it of stones<br/>and planted it with the choicest vines.<br/>He built a watchtower in it<br/>and cut out a winepress as well.<br/>Then he looked for a crop of good grapes,<br/>but it yielded only bad fruit.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>“Now you dwellers in Jerusalem and men of Judah,<br/>judge between me and my vineyard.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>What more could have been done for my vineyard<br/>than I have done for it?<br/>When I looked for good grapes,<br/>why did it yield only bad?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>Now I will tell you<br/>what I am going to do to my vineyard:<br/>I will take away its hedge,<br/>and it will be destroyed;<br/>I will break down its wall,<br/>and it will be trampled.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>I will make it a wasteland,<br/>neither pruned nor cultivated,<br/>and briers and thorns will grow there.<br/>I will command the clouds<br/>not to rain on it.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>The vineyard of the Lord Almighty<br/>is the house of Israel,<br/>and the men of Judah<br/>are the garden of his delight.<br/>And he looked for justice, but saw bloodshed;<br/>for righteousness, but heard cries of distress.</span></p><h2>Woes and Judgments</h2><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>Woe to you who add house to house<br/>and join field to field<br/>till no space is left<br/>and you live alone in the land.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>The Lord Almighty has declared in my hearing:<br/>“Surely the great houses will become desolate,<br/>the fine mansions left without occupants.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>A ten-acre vineyard will produce only a bath of wine,<br/>a homer of seed only an ephah of grain.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>Woe to those who rise early in the morning<br/>to run after their drinks,<br/>who stay up late at night<br/>till they are inflamed with wine.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>They have harps and lyres at their banquets,<br/>tambourines and flutes and wine,<br/>but they have no regard for the deeds of the Lord,<br/>no respect for the work of his hands.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>Therefore my people will go into exile<br/>for lack of understanding;<br/>their men of rank will die of hunger<br/>and their masses will be parched with thirst.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>Therefore the grave enlarges its appetite<br/>and opens its mouth without limit;<br/>into it will descend their nobles and masses<br/>with all their brawlers and revelers.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>So man will be brought low<br/>and mankind humbled,<br/>the eyes of the arrogant humbled.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>16</b>But the Lord Almighty will be exalted by his justice,<br/>and the holy God will show himself holy by his righteousness.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>Then sheep will graze as in their own pasture;<br/>lambs will feed among the ruins of the rich.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>18</b>Woe to those who draw sin along with cords of deceit,<br/>and wickedness as with cart ropes,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>to those who say, “Let God hurry,<br/>let him hasten his work<br/>so we may see it.<br/>Let it approach,<br/>let the plan of the Holy One of Israel come,<br/>so we may know it.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>Woe to those who call evil good<br/>and good evil,<br/>who put darkness for light<br/>and light for darkness,<br/>who put bitter for sweet<br/>and sweet for bitter.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>21</b>Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes<br/>and clever in their own sight.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>22</b>Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine<br/>and champions at mixing drinks,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>23</b>who acquit the guilty for a bribe,<br/>but deny justice to the innocent.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>24</b>Therefore, as tongues of fire lick up straw<br/>and as dry grass sinks down in the flames,<br/>so their roots will decay<br/>and their flowers blow away like dust;<br/>for they have rejected the law of the Lord Almighty<br/>and spurned the word of the Holy One of Israel.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>25</b>Therefore the Lord's anger burns against his people;<br/>his hand is raised and he strikes them down.<br/>The mountains shake,<br/>and the dead bodies are like refuse in the streets.<br/><br/>Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away,<br/>his hand is still upraised.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>26</b>He lifts up a banner for the distant nations,<br/>he whistles for those at the ends of the earth.<br/>Here they come,<br/>swiftly and speedily!</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>27</b>Not one of them grows tired or stumbles,<br/>not one slumbers or sleeps;<br/>not a belt is loosened at the waist,<br/>not a sandal thong is broken.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>28</b>Their arrows are sharp,<br/>all their bows are strung;<br/>their horses' hoofs seem like flint,<br/>their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>29</b>Their roar is like that of the lion,<br/>they roar like young lions;<br/>they growl as they seize their prey<br/>and carry it off with no one to rescue.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>30</b>In that day they will roar over it<br/>like the roaring of the sea.<br/>And if one looks at the land,<br/>he will see darkness and distress;<br/>even the light will be darkened by the clouds.</span></p>

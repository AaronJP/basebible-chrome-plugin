<h1>Psalm 107</h1><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;<br/>his love endures forever.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>2</b>Let the redeemed of the Lord say thisâ€”<br/>those he redeemed from the hand of the foe,</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>those he gathered from the lands,<br/>from east and west, from north and south.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>4</b>Some wandered in desert wastelands,<br/>finding no way to a city where they could settle.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>They were hungry and thirsty,<br/>and their lives ebbed away.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>6</b>Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble,<br/>and he delivered them from their distress.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>7</b>He led them by a straight way<br/>to a city where they could settle.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>8</b>Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love<br/>and his wonderful deeds for men,</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>for he satisfies the thirsty<br/>and fills the hungry with good things.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>10</b>Some sat in darkness and the deepest gloom,<br/>prisoners suffering in iron chains,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>11</b>for they had rebelled against the words of God<br/>and despised the counsel of the Most High.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>12</b>So he subjected them to bitter labor;<br/>they stumbled, and there was no one to help.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>13</b>Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,<br/>and he saved them from their distress.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>14</b>He brought them out of darkness and the deepest gloom<br/>and broke away their chains.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>15</b>Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love<br/>and his wonderful deeds for men,</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>for he breaks down gates of bronze<br/>and cuts through bars of iron.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>17</b>Some became fools through their rebellious ways<br/>and suffered affliction because of their iniquities.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>18</b>They loathed all food<br/>and drew near the gates of death.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>19</b>Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,<br/>and he saved them from their distress.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>20</b>He sent forth his word and healed them;<br/>he rescued them from the grave.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>21</b>Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love<br/>and his wonderful deeds for men.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>22</b>Let them sacrifice thank offerings<br/>and tell of his works with songs of joy.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>23</b>Others went out on the sea in ships;<br/>they were merchants on the mighty waters.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>24</b>They saw the works of the Lord,<br/>his wonderful deeds in the deep.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>25</b>For he spoke and stirred up a tempest<br/>that lifted high the waves.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>26</b>They mounted up to the heavens and went down to the depths;<br/>in their peril their courage melted away.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>27</b>They reeled and staggered like drunken men;<br/>they were at their wits' end.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>28</b>Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble,<br/>and he brought them out of their distress.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>29</b>He stilled the storm to a whisper;<br/>the waves of the sea were hushed.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>30</b>They were glad when it grew calm,<br/>and he guided them to their desired haven.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>31</b>Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love<br/>and his wonderful deeds for men.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>32</b>Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people<br/>and praise him in the council of the elders.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>33</b>He turned rivers into a desert,<br/>flowing springs into thirsty ground,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>34</b>and fruitful land into a salt waste,<br/>because of the wickedness of those who lived there.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>35</b>He turned the desert into pools of water<br/>and the parched ground into flowing springs;</span></p><p/><p><span><b>36</b>there he brought the hungry to live,<br/>and they founded a city where they could settle.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>37</b>They sowed fields and planted vineyards<br/>that yielded a fruitful harvest;</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>38</b>he blessed them, and their numbers greatly increased,<br/>and he did not let their herds diminish.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>39</b>Then their numbers decreased, and they were humbled<br/>by oppression, calamity and sorrow;</span></p><p/><p><span><b>40</b>he who pours contempt on nobles<br/>made them wander in a trackless waste.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>41</b>But he lifted the needy out of their affliction<br/>and increased their families like flocks.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>42</b>The upright see and rejoice,<br/>but all the wicked shut their mouths.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>43</b>Whoever is wise, let him heed these things<br/>and consider the great love of the Lord.</span></p>

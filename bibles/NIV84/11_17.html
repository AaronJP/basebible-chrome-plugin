<h1>1 Kings 17</h1><h2>Elijah Fed by Ravens</h2><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Now Elijah the Tishbite, from Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab, “As the Lord, the God of Israel, lives, whom I serve, there will be neither dew nor rain in the next few years except at my word.”</span><span><b>2</b>Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah:</span><span><b>3</b>“Leave here, turn eastward and hide in the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan.</span></p><p><span><b>4</b>You will drink from the brook, and I have ordered the ravens to feed you there.”</span><span><b>5</b>So he did what the Lord had told him. He went to the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan, and stayed there.</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook.</span></p><h2>The Widow at Zarephath</h2><p><span><b>7</b>Some time later the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land.</span><span><b>8</b>Then the word of the Lord came to him:</span><span><b>9</b>“Go at once to Zarephath of Sidon and stay there. I have commanded a widow in that place to supply you with food.”</span><span><b>10</b>So he went to Zarephath. When he came to the town gate, a widow was there gathering sticks. He called to her and asked, “Would you bring me a little water in a jar so I may have a drink?”</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>As she was going to get it, he called, “And bring me, please, a piece of bread.”</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>“As surely as the Lord your God lives,” she replied, “I don't have any bread—only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. I am gathering a few sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son, that we may eat it—and die.”</span><span><b>13</b>Elijah said to her, “Don't be afraid. Go home and do as you have said. But first make a small cake of bread for me from what you have and bring it to me, and then make something for yourself and your son.</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the Lord gives rain on the land.’ ”</span><span><b>15</b>She went away and did as Elijah had told her. So there was food every day for Elijah and for the woman and her family.</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>For the jar of flour was not used up and the jug of oil did not run dry, in keeping with the word of the Lord spoken by Elijah.</span><span><b>17</b>Some time later the son of the woman who owned the house became ill. He grew worse and worse, and finally stopped breathing.</span></p><p><span><b>18</b>She said to Elijah, “What do you have against me, man of God? Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son?”</span><span><b>19</b>“Give me your son,” Elijah replied. He took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his bed.</span><span><b>20</b>Then he cried out to the Lord, “O Lord my God, have you brought tragedy also upon this widow I am staying with, by causing her son to die?”</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>Then he stretched himself out on the boy three times and cried to the Lord, “O Lord my God, let this boy's life return to him!”</span><span><b>22</b>The Lord heard Elijah's cry, and the boy's life returned to him, and he lived.</span></p><p><span><b>23</b>Elijah picked up the child and carried him down from the room into the house. He gave him to his mother and said, “Look, your son is alive!”</span></p><p><span><b>24</b>Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the Lord from your mouth is the truth.”</span></p>

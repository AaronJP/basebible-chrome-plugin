<h1>Psalm 12</h1><h2>For the director of music. According to sheminith. A psalm of David.</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Help, Lord, for the godly are no more;<br/>the faithful have vanished from among men.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>Everyone lies to his neighbor;<br/>their flattering lips speak with deception.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>May the Lord cut off all flattering lips<br/>and every boastful tongue</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>that says, “We will triumph with our tongues;<br/>we own our lips—who is our master?”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>“Because of the oppression of the weak<br/>and the groaning of the needy,<br/>I will now arise,” says the Lord.<br/>“I will protect them from those who malign them.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>And the words of the Lord are flawless,<br/>like silver refined in a furnace of clay,<br/>purified seven times.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>7</b>O Lord, you will keep us safe<br/>and protect us from such people forever.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>8</b>The wicked freely strut about<br/>when what is vile is honored among men.</span></p>

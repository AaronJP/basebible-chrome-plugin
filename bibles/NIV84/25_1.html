<h1>Lamentations 1</h1><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>How deserted lies the city,<br/>once so full of people!<br/>How like a widow is she,<br/>who once was great among the nations!<br/>She who was queen among the provinces<br/>has now become a slave.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>Bitterly she weeps at night,<br/>tears are upon her cheeks.<br/>Among all her lovers<br/>there is none to comfort her.<br/>All her friends have betrayed her;<br/>they have become her enemies.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>After affliction and harsh labor,<br/>Judah has gone into exile.<br/>She dwells among the nations;<br/>she finds no resting place.<br/>All who pursue her have overtaken her<br/>in the midst of her distress.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>The roads to Zion mourn,<br/>for no one comes to her appointed feasts.<br/>All her gateways are desolate,<br/>her priests groan,<br/>her maidens grieve,<br/>and she is in bitter anguish.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>Her foes have become her masters;<br/>her enemies are at ease.<br/>The Lord has brought her grief<br/>because of her many sins.<br/>Her children have gone into exile,<br/>captive before the foe.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>All the splendor has departed<br/>from the Daughter of Zion.<br/>Her princes are like deer<br/>that find no pasture;<br/>in weakness they have fled<br/>before the pursuer.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>In the days of her affliction and wandering<br/>Jerusalem remembers all the treasures<br/>that were hers in days of old.<br/>When her people fell into enemy hands,<br/>there was no one to help her.<br/>Her enemies looked at her<br/>and laughed at her destruction.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>Jerusalem has sinned greatly<br/>and so has become unclean.<br/>All who honored her despise her,<br/>for they have seen her nakedness;<br/>she herself groans<br/>and turns away.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>Her filthiness clung to her skirts;<br/>she did not consider her future.<br/>Her fall was astounding;<br/>there was none to comfort her.<br/>“Look, O Lord, on my affliction,<br/>for the enemy has triumphed.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>The enemy laid hands<br/>on all her treasures;<br/>she saw pagan nations<br/>enter her sanctuary—<br/>those you had forbidden<br/>to enter your assembly.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>All her people groan<br/>as they search for bread;<br/>they barter their treasures for food<br/>to keep themselves alive.<br/>“Look, O Lord, and consider,<br/>for I am despised.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>“Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?<br/>Look around and see.<br/>Is any suffering like my suffering<br/>that was inflicted on me,<br/>that the Lord brought on me<br/>in the day of his fierce anger?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>“From on high he sent fire,<br/>sent it down into my bones.<br/>He spread a net for my feet<br/>and turned me back.<br/>He made me desolate,<br/>faint all the day long.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>“My sins have been bound into a yoke;<br/>by his hands they were woven together.<br/>They have come upon my neck<br/>and the Lord has sapped my strength.<br/>He has handed me over<br/>to those I cannot withstand.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>“The Lord has rejected<br/>all the warriors in my midst;<br/>he has summoned an army against me<br/>to crush my young men.<br/>In his winepress the Lord has trampled<br/>the Virgin Daughter of Judah.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>“This is why I weep<br/>and my eyes overflow with tears.<br/>No one is near to comfort me,<br/>no one to restore my spirit.<br/>My children are destitute<br/>because the enemy has prevailed.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>Zion stretches out her hands,<br/>but there is no one to comfort her.<br/>The Lord has decreed for Jacob<br/>that his neighbors become his foes;<br/>Jerusalem has become<br/>an unclean thing among them.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>“The Lord is righteous,<br/>yet I rebelled against his command.<br/>Listen, all you peoples;<br/>look upon my suffering.<br/>My young men and maidens<br/>have gone into exile.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>“I called to my allies<br/>but they betrayed me.<br/>My priests and my elders<br/>perished in the city<br/>while they searched for food<br/>to keep themselves alive.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>“See, O Lord, how distressed I am!<br/>I am in torment within,<br/>and in my heart I am disturbed,<br/>for I have been most rebellious.<br/>Outside, the sword bereaves;<br/>inside, there is only death.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>21</b>“People have heard my groaning,<br/>but there is no one to comfort me.<br/>All my enemies have heard of my distress;<br/>they rejoice at what you have done.<br/>May you bring the day you have announced<br/>so they may become like me.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>22</b>“Let all their wickedness come before you;<br/>deal with them<br/>as you have dealt with me<br/>because of all my sins.<br/>My groans are many<br/>and my heart is faint.”</span></p>

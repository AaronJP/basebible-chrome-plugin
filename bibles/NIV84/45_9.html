<h1>Romans 9</h1><h2>God's Sovereign Choice</h2><p><span><b>1</b>I speak the truth in Christ–I am not lying, my conscience confirms it in the Holy Spirit–</span><span><b>2</b>I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.</span><span><b>3</b>For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, those of my own race,</span><span><b>4</b>the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises.</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of Christ, who is God over all, forever praised! Amen.</span><span><b>6</b>It is not as though God's word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.</span><span><b>7</b>Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham's children. On the contrary, “It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.”</span><span><b>8</b>In other words, it is not the natural children who are God's children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham's offspring.</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>For this was how the promise was stated: “At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”</span><span><b>10</b>Not only that, but Rebekah's children had one and the same father, our father Isaac.</span><span><b>11</b>Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad–in order that God's purpose in election might stand:</span><span><b>12</b>not by works but by him who calls–she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>Just as it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”</span><span><b>14</b>What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all!</span></p><p/><p><span><b>15</b>For he says to Moses,<br/>“I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,<br/>and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”</span><span><b>16</b>It does not, therefore, depend on man's desire or effort, but on God's mercy.</span><span><b>17</b>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”</span></p><p><span><b>18</b>Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden.</span><span><b>19</b>One of you will say to me: “Then why does God still blame us? For who resists his will?”</span><span><b>20</b>But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? “Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’ ”</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use?</span><span><b>22</b>What if God, choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath–prepared for destruction?</span><span><b>23</b>What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory–</span><span><b>24</b>even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?</span></p><p/><p><span><b>25</b>As he says in Hosea:<br/>“I will call them ‘my people’ who are not my people;<br/>and I will call her ‘my loved one’ who is not my loved one,”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>26</b>and,<br/>“It will happen that in the very place where it was said to them,<br/>‘You are not my people,’<br/>they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’ ”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>27</b>Isaiah cries out concerning Israel:<br/>“Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea,<br/>only the remnant will be saved.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>28</b>For the Lord will carry out<br/>his sentence on earth with speed and finality.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>29</b>It is just as Isaiah said previously:<br/>“Unless the Lord Almighty<br/>had left us descendants,<br/>we would have become like Sodom,<br/>we would have been like Gomorrah.”</span></p><h2>Israel's Unbelief</h2><p><span><b>30</b>What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith;</span><span><b>31</b>but Israel, who pursued a law of righteousness, has not attained it.</span><span><b>32</b>Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the “stumbling stone.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>33</b>As it is written:<br/>“See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes men to stumble<br/>and a rock that makes them fall,<br/>and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.”</span></p>

<h1>1 Thessalonians 5</h1><p><span><b>1</b>Now, brothers, about times and dates we do not need to write to you,</span><span><b>2</b>for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.</span></p><p><span><b>3</b>While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.</span><span><b>4</b>But you, brothers, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief.</span><span><b>5</b>You are all sons of the light and sons of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness.</span><span><b>6</b>So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be alert and self‑controlled.</span><span><b>7</b>For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.</span><span><b>8</b>But since we belong to the day, let us be self‑controlled, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.</span><span><b>9</b>For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span><span><b>10</b>He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.</span></p><h2>Final Instructions</h2><p><span><b>12</b>Now we ask you, brothers, to respect those who work hard among you, who are over you in the Lord and who admonish you.</span><span><b>13</b>Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other.</span><span><b>14</b>And we urge you, brothers, warn those who are idle, encourage the timid, help the weak, be patient with everyone.</span></p><p><span><b>15</b>Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always try to be kind to each other and to everyone else.</span><span><b>16</b>Be joyful always;</span><span><b>17</b>pray continually;</span></p><p><span><b>18</b>give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.</span><span><b>19</b>Do not put out the Spirit's fire;</span><span><b>20</b>do not treat prophecies with contempt.</span><span><b>21</b>Test everything. Hold on to the good.</span></p><p><span><b>22</b>Avoid every kind of evil.</span><span><b>23</b>May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>24</b>The one who calls you is faithful and he will do it.</span><span><b>25</b>Brothers, pray for us.</span><span><b>26</b>Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.</span></p><p><span><b>27</b>I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.</span><span><b>28</b>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</span></p>

<h1>Luke 24</h1><h2>The Resurrection</h2><p><span><b>1</b>On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.</span><span><b>2</b>They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,</span><span><b>3</b>but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</span><span><b>4</b>While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.</span><span><b>5</b>In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead?</span><span><b>6</b>He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee:</span><span><b>7</b>‘The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.’ ”</span></p><p><span><b>8</b>Then they remembered his words.</span><span><b>9</b>When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.</span><span><b>10</b>It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles.</span><span><b>11</b>But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense.</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.</span></p><h2>On the Road to Emmaus</h2><p><span><b>13</b>Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.</span><span><b>14</b>They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.</span><span><b>15</b>As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them;</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>but they were kept from recognizing him.</span></p><p><span><b>17</b>He asked them, “What are you discussing together as you walk along?”<br/>They stood still, their faces downcast.</span></p><p><span><b>18</b>One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, “Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?”</span></p><p><span><b>19</b>“What things?” he asked.<br/>“About Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. “He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.</span><span><b>20</b>The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him;</span><span><b>21</b>but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place.</span><span><b>22</b>In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning</span><span><b>23</b>but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive.</span></p><p><span><b>24</b>Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.”</span><span><b>25</b>He said to them, “How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</span><span><b>26</b>Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?”</span></p><p><span><b>27</b>And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.</span><span><b>28</b>As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther.</span></p><p><span><b>29</b>But they urged him strongly, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.” So he went in to stay with them.</span><span><b>30</b>When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them.</span><span><b>31</b>Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight.</span></p><p><span><b>32</b>They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”</span><span><b>33</b>They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together</span><span><b>34</b>and saying, “It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.”</span></p><p><span><b>35</b>Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.</span></p><h2>Jesus Appears to the Disciples</h2><p/><p><span><b>36</b>While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.”</span><span><b>37</b>They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost.</span><span><b>38</b>He said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?</span></p><p><span><b>39</b>Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.”</span><span><b>40</b>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet.</span><span><b>41</b>And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?”</span><span><b>42</b>They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</span></p><p><span><b>43</b>and he took it and ate it in their presence.</span></p><p><span><b>44</b>He said to them, “This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.”</span><span><b>45</b>Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.</span><span><b>46</b>He told them, “This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,</span><span><b>47</b>and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</span><span><b>48</b>You are witnesses of these things.</span></p><p><span><b>49</b>I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”</span></p><h2>The Ascension</h2><p><span><b>50</b>When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them.</span><span><b>51</b>While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven.</span><span><b>52</b>Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</span><span><b>53</b>And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.</span></p>

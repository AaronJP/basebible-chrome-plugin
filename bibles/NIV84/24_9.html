<h1>Jeremiah 9</h1><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Oh, that my head were a spring of water<br/>and my eyes a fountain of tears!<br/>I would weep day and night<br/>for the slain of my people.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>Oh, that I had in the desert<br/>a lodging place for travelers,<br/>so that I might leave my people<br/>and go away from them;<br/>for they are all adulterers,<br/>a crowd of unfaithful people.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>“They make ready their tongue<br/>like a bow, to shoot lies;<br/>it is not by truth<br/>that they triumph in the land.<br/>They go from one sin to another;<br/>they do not acknowledge me,”<br/>declares the Lord.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>“Beware of your friends;<br/>do not trust your brothers.<br/>For every brother is a deceiver,<br/>and every friend a slanderer.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>Friend deceives friend,<br/>and no one speaks the truth.<br/>They have taught their tongues to lie;<br/>they weary themselves with sinning.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>You live in the midst of deception;<br/>in their deceit they refuse to acknowledge me,”<br/>declares the Lord.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty says:<br/>“See, I will refine and test them,<br/>for what else can I do<br/>because of the sin of my people?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>Their tongue is a deadly arrow;<br/>it speaks with deceit.<br/>With his mouth each speaks cordially to his neighbor,<br/>but in his heart he sets a trap for him.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>Should I not punish them for this?”<br/>declares the Lord.<br/>“Should I not avenge myself<br/>on such a nation as this?”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>I will weep and wail for the mountains<br/>and take up a lament concerning the desert pastures.<br/>They are desolate and untraveled,<br/>and the lowing of cattle is not heard.<br/>The birds of the air have fled<br/>and the animals are gone.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>“I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins,<br/>a haunt of jackals;<br/>and I will lay waste the towns of Judah<br/>so no one can live there.”</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>What man is wise enough to understand this? Who has been instructed by the Lord and can explain it? Why has the land been ruined and laid waste like a desert that no one can cross?</span><span><b>13</b>The Lord said, “It is because they have forsaken my law, which I set before them; they have not obeyed me or followed my law.</span><span><b>14</b>Instead, they have followed the stubbornness of their hearts; they have followed the Baals, as their fathers taught them.”</span><span><b>15</b>Therefore, this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “See, I will make this people eat bitter food and drink poisoned water.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>16</b>I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their fathers have known, and I will pursue them with the sword until I have destroyed them.”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>This is what the Lord Almighty says:<br/>“Consider now! Call for the wailing women to come;<br/>send for the most skillful of them.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>Let them come quickly<br/>and wail over us<br/>till our eyes overflow with tears<br/>and water streams from our eyelids.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>The sound of wailing is heard from Zion:<br/>‘How ruined we are!<br/>How great is our shame!<br/>We must leave our land<br/>because our houses are in ruins.’ ”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>Now, O women, hear the word of the Lord;<br/>open your ears to the words of his mouth.<br/>Teach your daughters how to wail;<br/>teach one another a lament.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>21</b>Death has climbed in through our windows<br/>and has entered our fortresses;<br/>it has cut off the children from the streets<br/>and the young men from the public squares.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>22</b>Say, “This is what the Lord declares:<br/>“ ‘The dead bodies of men will lie<br/>like refuse on the open field,<br/>like cut grain behind the reaper,<br/>with no one to gather them.’ ”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>23</b>This is what the Lord says:<br/>“Let not the wise man boast of his wisdom<br/>or the strong man boast of his strength<br/>or the rich man boast of his riches,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>24</b>but let him who boasts boast about this:<br/>that he understands and knows me,<br/>that I am the Lord, who exercises kindness,<br/>justice and righteousness on earth,<br/>for in these I delight,”<br/>declares the Lord.</span><span><b>25</b>“The days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh—</span></p><p><span><b>26</b>Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab and all who live in the desert in distant places. For all these nations are really uncircumcised, and even the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.”</span></p>

<h1>1 Timothy 4</h1><h2>Instructions to Timothy</h2><p><span><b>1</b>The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.</span><span><b>2</b>Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron.</span><span><b>3</b>They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth.</span><span><b>4</b>For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.</span><span><b>6</b>If you point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, brought up in the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed.</span><span><b>7</b>Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives' tales; rather, train yourself to be godly.</span></p><p><span><b>8</b>For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.</span><span><b>9</b>This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>(and for this we labor and strive), that we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, and especially of those who believe.</span><span><b>11</b>Command and teach these things.</span><span><b>12</b>Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity.</span><span><b>13</b>Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching.</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through a prophetic message when the body of elders laid their hands on you.</span><span><b>15</b>Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress.</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.</span></p>

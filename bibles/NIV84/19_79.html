<h1>Psalm 79</h1><h2>A psalm of Asaph.</h2><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance;<br/>they have defiled your holy temple,<br/>they have reduced Jerusalem to rubble.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>They have given the dead bodies of your servants<br/>as food to the birds of the air,<br/>the flesh of your saints to the beasts of the earth.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>They have poured out blood like water<br/>all around Jerusalem,<br/>and there is no one to bury the dead.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>We are objects of reproach to our neighbors,<br/>of scorn and derision to those around us.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>How long, O Lord? Will you be angry forever?<br/>How long will your jealousy burn like fire?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>Pour out your wrath on the nations<br/>that do not acknowledge you,<br/>on the kingdoms<br/>that do not call on your name;</span></p><p/><p><span><b>7</b>for they have devoured Jacob<br/>and destroyed his homeland.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>Do not hold against us the sins of the fathers;<br/>may your mercy come quickly to meet us,<br/>for we are in desperate need.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>Help us, O God our Savior,<br/>for the glory of your name;<br/>deliver us and forgive our sins<br/>for your name's sake.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>Why should the nations say,<br/>“Where is their God?”<br/>Before our eyes, make known among the nations<br/>that you avenge the outpoured blood of your servants.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>May the groans of the prisoners come before you;<br/>by the strength of your arm<br/>preserve those condemned to die.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>12</b>Pay back into the laps of our neighbors seven times<br/>the reproach they have hurled at you, O Lord.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>Then we your people, the sheep of your pasture,<br/>will praise you forever;<br/>from generation to generation<br/>we will recount your praise.</span></p>

<h1>Micah 3</h1><h2>Leaders and Prophets Rebuked</h2><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Then I said,<br/>“Listen, you leaders of Jacob,<br/>you rulers of the house of Israel.<br/>Should you not know justice,</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>you who hate good and love evil;<br/>who tear the skin from my people<br/>and the flesh from their bones;</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>who eat my people's flesh,<br/>strip off their skin<br/>and break their bones in pieces;<br/>who chop them up like meat for the pan,<br/>like flesh for the pot?”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>Then they will cry out to the Lord,<br/>but he will not answer them.<br/>At that time he will hide his face from them<br/>because of the evil they have done.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>This is what the Lord says:<br/>“As for the prophets<br/>who lead my people astray,<br/>if one feeds them,<br/>they proclaim ‘peace’;<br/>if he does not,<br/>they prepare to wage war against him.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>Therefore night will come over you, without visions,<br/>and darkness, without divination.<br/>The sun will set for the prophets,<br/>and the day will go dark for them.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>The seers will be ashamed<br/>and the diviners disgraced.<br/>They will all cover their faces<br/>because there is no answer from God.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>But as for me, I am filled with power,<br/>with the Spirit of the Lord,<br/>and with justice and might,<br/>to declare to Jacob his transgression,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>Hear this, you leaders of the house of Jacob,<br/>you rulers of the house of Israel,<br/>who despise justice<br/>and distort all that is right;</span></p><p/><p><span><b>10</b>who build Zion with bloodshed,<br/>and Jerusalem with wickedness.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>Her leaders judge for a bribe,<br/>her priests teach for a price,<br/>and her prophets tell fortunes for money.<br/>Yet they lean upon the Lord and say,<br/>“Is not the Lord among us?<br/>No disaster will come upon us.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>Therefore because of you,<br/>Zion will be plowed like a field,<br/>Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble,<br/>the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets.</span></p>

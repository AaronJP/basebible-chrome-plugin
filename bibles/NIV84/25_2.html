<h1>Lamentations 2</h1><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>How the Lord has covered the Daughter of Zion<br/>with the cloud of his anger!<br/>He has hurled down the splendor of Israel<br/>from heaven to earth;<br/>he has not remembered his footstool<br/>in the day of his anger.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>Without pity the Lord has swallowed up<br/>all the dwellings of Jacob;<br/>in his wrath he has torn down<br/>the strongholds of the Daughter of Judah.<br/>He has brought her kingdom and its princes<br/>down to the ground in dishonor.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>In fierce anger he has cut off<br/>every horn of Israel.<br/>He has withdrawn his right hand<br/>at the approach of the enemy.<br/>He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire<br/>that consumes everything around it.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>Like an enemy he has strung his bow;<br/>his right hand is ready.<br/>Like a foe he has slain<br/>all who were pleasing to the eye;<br/>he has poured out his wrath like fire<br/>on the tent of the Daughter of Zion.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>The Lord is like an enemy;<br/>he has swallowed up Israel.<br/>He has swallowed up all her palaces<br/>and destroyed her strongholds.<br/>He has multiplied mourning and lamentation<br/>for the Daughter of Judah.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>He has laid waste his dwelling like a garden;<br/>he has destroyed his place of meeting.<br/>The Lord has made Zion forget<br/>her appointed feasts and her Sabbaths;<br/>in his fierce anger he has spurned<br/>both king and priest.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>The Lord has rejected his altar<br/>and abandoned his sanctuary.<br/>He has handed over to the enemy<br/>the walls of her palaces;<br/>they have raised a shout in the house of the Lord<br/>as on the day of an appointed feast.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>The Lord determined to tear down<br/>the wall around the Daughter of Zion.<br/>He stretched out a measuring line<br/>and did not withhold his hand from destroying.<br/>He made ramparts and walls lament;<br/>together they wasted away.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>Her gates have sunk into the ground;<br/>their bars he has broken and destroyed.<br/>Her king and her princes are exiled among the nations,<br/>the law is no more,<br/>and her prophets no longer find<br/>visions from the Lord.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>The elders of the Daughter of Zion<br/>sit on the ground in silence;<br/>they have sprinkled dust on their heads<br/>and put on sackcloth.<br/>The young women of Jerusalem<br/>have bowed their heads to the ground.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>My eyes fail from weeping,<br/>I am in torment within,<br/>my heart is poured out on the ground<br/>because my people are destroyed,<br/>because children and infants faint<br/>in the streets of the city.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>They say to their mothers,<br/>“Where is bread and wine?”<br/>as they faint like wounded men<br/>in the streets of the city,<br/>as their lives ebb away<br/>in their mothers' arms.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>What can I say for you?<br/>With what can I compare you,<br/>O Daughter of Jerusalem?<br/>To what can I liken you,<br/>that I may comfort you,<br/>O Virgin Daughter of Zion?<br/>Your wound is as deep as the sea.<br/>Who can heal you?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>The visions of your prophets<br/>were false and worthless;<br/>they did not expose your sin<br/>to ward off your captivity.<br/>The oracles they gave you<br/>were false and misleading.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>All who pass your way<br/>clap their hands at you;<br/>they scoff and shake their heads<br/>at the Daughter of Jerusalem:<br/>“Is this the city that was called<br/>the perfection of beauty,<br/>the joy of the whole earth?”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>All your enemies open their mouths<br/>wide against you;<br/>they scoff and gnash their teeth<br/>and say, “We have swallowed her up.<br/>This is the day we have waited for;<br/>we have lived to see it.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>The Lord has done what he planned;<br/>he has fulfilled his word,<br/>which he decreed long ago.<br/>He has overthrown you without pity,<br/>he has let the enemy gloat over you,<br/>he has exalted the horn of your foes.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>The hearts of the people<br/>cry out to the Lord.<br/>O wall of the Daughter of Zion,<br/>let your tears flow like a river<br/>day and night;<br/>give yourself no relief,<br/>your eyes no rest.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>Arise, cry out in the night,<br/>as the watches of the night begin;<br/>pour out your heart like water<br/>in the presence of the Lord.<br/>Lift up your hands to him<br/>for the lives of your children,<br/>who faint from hunger<br/>at the head of every street.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>“Look, O Lord, and consider:<br/>Whom have you ever treated like this?<br/>Should women eat their offspring,<br/>the children they have cared for?<br/>Should priest and prophet be killed<br/>in the sanctuary of the Lord?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>21</b>“Young and old lie together<br/>in the dust of the streets;<br/>my young men and maidens<br/>have fallen by the sword.<br/>You have slain them in the day of your anger;<br/>you have slaughtered them without pity.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>22</b>“As you summon to a feast day,<br/>so you summoned against me terrors on every side.<br/>In the day of the Lord's anger<br/>no one escaped or survived;<br/>those I cared for and reared,<br/>my enemy has destroyed.”</span></p>

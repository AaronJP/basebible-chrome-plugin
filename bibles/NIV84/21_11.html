<h1>Ecclesiastes 11</h1><h2>Bread Upon the Waters</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Cast your bread upon the waters,<br/>for after many days you will find it again.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>Give portions to seven, yes to eight,<br/>for you do not know what disaster may come upon the land.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>If clouds are full of water,<br/>they pour rain upon the earth.<br/>Whether a tree falls to the south or to the north,<br/>in the place where it falls, there will it lie.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>Whoever watches the wind will not plant;<br/>whoever looks at the clouds will not reap.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>As you do not know the path of the wind,<br/>or how the body is formed in a mother's womb,<br/>so you cannot understand the work of God,<br/>the Maker of all things.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>Sow your seed in the morning,<br/>and at evening let not your hands be idle,<br/>for you do not know which will succeed,<br/>whether this or that,<br/>or whether both will do equally well.</span></p><h2>Remember Your Creator While Young</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>Light is sweet,<br/>and it pleases the eyes to see the sun.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>However many years a man may live,<br/>let him enjoy them all.<br/>But let him remember the days of darkness,<br/>for they will be many.<br/>Everything to come is meaningless.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>Be happy, young man, while you are young,<br/>and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth.<br/>Follow the ways of your heart<br/>and whatever your eyes see,<br/>but know that for all these things<br/>God will bring you to judgment.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>So then, banish anxiety from your heart<br/>and cast off the troubles of your body,<br/>for youth and vigor are meaningless.</span></p>

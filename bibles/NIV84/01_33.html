<h1>Genesis 33</h1><h2>Jacob Meets Esau</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Jacob looked up and there was Esau, coming with his four hundred men; so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two maidservants.</span><span><b>2</b>He put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear.</span></p><p><span><b>3</b>He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.</span><span><b>4</b>But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. “Who are these with you?” he asked.<br/>Jacob answered, “They are the children God has graciously given your servant.”</span><span><b>6</b>Then the maidservants and their children approached and bowed down.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>8</b>Esau asked, “What do you mean by all these droves I met?”<br/>“To find favor in your eyes, my lord,” he said.</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>But Esau said, “I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself.”</span><span><b>10</b>“No, please!” said Jacob. “If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably.</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.” And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it.</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>Then Esau said, “Let us be on our way; I'll accompany you.”</span><span><b>13</b>But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die.</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the droves before me and that of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>15</b>Esau said, “Then let me leave some of my men with you.”<br/>“But why do that?” Jacob asked. “Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.”</span><span><b>16</b>So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir.</span></p><p><span><b>17</b>Jacob, however, went to Succoth, where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Succoth.</span><span><b>18</b>After Jacob came from Paddan Aram, he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city.</span><span><b>19</b>For a hundred pieces of silver, he bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, the plot of ground where he pitched his tent.</span></p><p><span><b>20</b>There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel.</span></p>

<h1>Mark 15</h1><h2>Jesus Before Pilate</h2><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision. They bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>2</b>“Are you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate.<br/>“Yes, it is as you say,” Jesus replied.</span><span><b>3</b>The chief priests accused him of many things.</span></p><p><span><b>4</b>So again Pilate asked him, “Aren't you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of.”</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed.</span><span><b>6</b>Now it was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested.</span><span><b>7</b>A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising.</span></p><p><span><b>8</b>The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did.</span><span><b>9</b>“Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate,</span><span><b>10</b>knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead.</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>“What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?” Pilate asked them.</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>“Crucify him!” they shouted.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>14</b>“Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate.<br/>But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!”</span></p><p><span><b>15</b>Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.</span></p><h2>The Soldiers Mock Jesus</h2><p><span><b>16</b>The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers.</span><span><b>17</b>They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him.</span><span><b>18</b>And they began to call out to him, “Hail, king of the Jews!”</span><span><b>19</b>Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him.</span></p><p><span><b>20</b>And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.</span></p><h2>The Crucifixion</h2><p><span><b>21</b>A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross.</span><span><b>22</b>They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull).</span><span><b>23</b>Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.</span></p><p><span><b>24</b>And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get.</span><span><b>25</b>It was the third hour when they crucified him.</span><span><b>26</b>The written notice of the charge against him read:<span class="otherquote">The King of the Jews</span>.</span><span><b>27</b>They crucified two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left.</span><span><b>29</b>Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, “So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days,</span></p><p><span><b>30</b>come down from the cross and save yourself!”</span><span><b>31</b>In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. “He saved others,” they said, “but he can't save himself!</span></p><p><span><b>32</b>Let this Christ, this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.” Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.</span></p><h2>The Death of Jesus</h2><p><span><b>33</b>At the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.</span></p><p><span><b>34</b>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?”–which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</span></p><p><span><b>35</b>When some of those standing near heard this, they said, “Listen, he's calling Elijah.”</span></p><p><span><b>36</b>One man ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. “Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down,” he said.</span></p><p><span><b>37</b>With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.</span><span><b>38</b>The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</span></p><p><span><b>39</b>And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and saw how he died, he said, “Surely this man was the Son of God!”</span><span><b>40</b>Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.</span></p><p><span><b>41</b>In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.</span></p><h2>The Burial of Jesus</h2><p><span><b>42</b>It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached,</span><span><b>43</b>Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.</span><span><b>44</b>Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died.</span><span><b>45</b>When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph.</span><span><b>46</b>So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.</span></p><p><span><b>47</b>Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.</span></p>

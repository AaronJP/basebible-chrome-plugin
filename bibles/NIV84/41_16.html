<h1>Mark 16</h1><h2>The Resurrection</h2><p><span><b>1</b>When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus' body.</span><span><b>2</b>Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb</span></p><p><span><b>3</b>and they asked each other, “Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?”</span><span><b>4</b>But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away.</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.</span><span><b>6</b>“Don't be alarmed,” he said. “You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.’ ”</span></p><p><span><b>8</b>Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.</span></p><h2> ((The most reliable early manuscripts and other ancient witnesses do not have Mark 16:9‑20.))</h2><p><span><b>9</b>When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons.</span><span><b>10</b>She went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping.</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it.</span><span><b>12</b>Afterward Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country.</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>These returned and reported it to the rest; but they did not believe them either.</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen.</span><span><b>15</b>He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation.</span><span><b>16</b>Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.</span><span><b>17</b>And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;</span></p><p><span><b>18</b>they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.”</span><span><b>19</b>After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God.</span><span><b>20</b>Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it.</span></p>

<h1>Genesis 32</h1><h2>Jacob Prepares to Meet Esau</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</span></p><p><span><b>2</b>When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is the camp of God!” So he named that place Mahanaim.</span><span><b>3</b>Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.</span><span><b>4</b>He instructed them: “This is what you are to say to my master Esau: ‘Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now.</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, menservants and maidservants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.’ ”</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.”</span><span><b>7</b>In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups, and the flocks and herds and camels as well.</span></p><p><span><b>8</b>He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one group, the group that is left may escape.”</span><span><b>9</b>Then Jacob prayed, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, O Lord, who said to me, ‘Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,’</span><span><b>10</b>I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two groups.</span><span><b>11</b>Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children.</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>But you have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.’ ”</span><span><b>13</b>He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau:</span><span><b>14</b>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</span><span><b>15</b>thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds.”</span><span><b>17</b>He instructed the one in the lead: “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?’</span></p><p><span><b>18</b>then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.’ ”</span><span><b>19</b>He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: “You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.</span><span><b>20</b>And be sure to say, ‘Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.’ ” For he thought, “I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me.”</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>So Jacob's gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.</span></p><h2>Jacob Wrestles With God</h2><p><span><b>22</b>That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two maidservants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.</span><span><b>23</b>After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions.</span><span><b>24</b>So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak.</span><span><b>25</b>When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob's hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>26</b>Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.”<br/>But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>27</b>The man asked him, “What is your name?”<br/>“Jacob,” he answered.</span></p><p><span><b>28</b>Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men and have overcome.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>29</b>Jacob said, “Please tell me your name.”<br/>But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed him there.</span></p><p><span><b>30</b>So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, “It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.”</span><span><b>31</b>The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip.</span></p><p><span><b>32</b>Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob's hip was touched near the tendon.</span></p>

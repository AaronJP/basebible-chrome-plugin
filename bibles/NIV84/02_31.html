<h1>Exodus 31</h1><h2>Bezalel and Oholiab</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Then the Lord said to Moses,</span><span><b>2</b>“See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,</span><span><b>3</b>and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, ability and knowledge in all kinds of crafts—</span><span><b>4</b>to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze,</span><span><b>5</b>to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds of craftsmanship.</span><span><b>6</b>Moreover, I have appointed Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, to help him. Also I have given skill to all the craftsmen to make everything I have commanded you:</span><span><b>7</b>the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the Testimony with the atonement cover on it, and all the other furnishings of the tent—</span><span><b>8</b>the table and its articles, the pure gold lampstand and all its accessories, the altar of incense,</span><span><b>9</b>the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, the basin with its stand—</span><span><b>10</b>and also the woven garments, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests,</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>and the anointing oil and fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make them just as I commanded you.”</span></p><h2>The Sabbath</h2><p><span><b>12</b>Then the Lord said to Moses,</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>“Say to the Israelites, ‘You must observe my Sabbaths. This will be a sign between me and you for the generations to come, so you may know that I am the Lord, who makes you holy.</span><span><b>14</b>“ ‘Observe the Sabbath, because it is holy to you. Anyone who desecrates it must be put to death; whoever does any work on that day must be cut off from his people.</span><span><b>15</b>For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day must be put to death.</span><span><b>16</b>The Israelites are to observe the Sabbath, celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant.</span></p><p><span><b>17</b>It will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he abstained from work and rested.’ ”</span></p><p><span><b>18</b>When the Lord finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of the Testimony, the tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God.</span></p>

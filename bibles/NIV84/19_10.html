<h1>Psalm 10</h1><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Why, O Lord, do you stand far off?<br/>Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?</span></p><p/><p><span><b>2</b>In his arrogance the wicked man hunts down the weak,<br/>who are caught in the schemes he devises.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>He boasts of the cravings of his heart;<br/>he blesses the greedy and reviles the Lord.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>4</b>In his pride the wicked does not seek him;<br/>in all his thoughts there is no room for God.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>His ways are always prosperous;<br/>he is haughty and your laws are far from him;<br/>he sneers at all his enemies.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>6</b>He says to himself, “Nothing will shake me;<br/>I'll always be happy and never have trouble.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>7</b>His mouth is full of curses and lies and threats;<br/>trouble and evil are under his tongue.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>He lies in wait near the villages;<br/>from ambush he murders the innocent,<br/>watching in secret for his victims.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>He lies in wait like a lion in cover;<br/>he lies in wait to catch the helpless;<br/>he catches the helpless and drags them off in his net.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>10</b>His victims are crushed, they collapse;<br/>they fall under his strength.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>He says to himself, “God has forgotten;<br/>he covers his face and never sees.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>12</b>Arise, Lord! Lift up your hand, O God.<br/>Do not forget the helpless.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>Why does the wicked man revile God?<br/>Why does he say to himself,<br/>“He won't call me to account”?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>But you, O God, do see trouble and grief;<br/>you consider it to take it in hand.<br/>The victim commits himself to you;<br/>you are the helper of the fatherless.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>Break the arm of the wicked and evil man;<br/>call him to account for his wickedness<br/>that would not be found out.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>16</b>The Lord is King for ever and ever;<br/>the nations will perish from his land.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>17</b>You hear, O Lord, the desire of the afflicted;<br/>you encourage them, and you listen to their cry,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>18</b>defending the fatherless and the oppressed,<br/>in order that man, who is of the earth, may terrify no more.</span></p>

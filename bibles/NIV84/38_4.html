<h1>Zechariah 4</h1><h2>The Gold Lampstand and the Two Olive Trees</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Then the angel who talked with me returned and wakened me, as a man is wakened from his sleep.</span></p><p><span><b>2</b>He asked me, “What do you see?”<br/>I answered, “I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top and seven lights on it, with seven channels to the lights.</span></p><p><span><b>3</b>Also there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.”</span></p><p><span><b>4</b>I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>He answered, “Do you not know what these are?”<br/>“No, my lord,” I replied.</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>So he said to me, “This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,’ says the Lord Almighty.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>“What are you, O mighty mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become level ground. Then he will bring out the capstone to shouts of ‘God bless it! God bless it!’ ”</span><span><b>8</b>Then the word of the Lord came to me:</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this temple; his hands will also complete it. Then you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>10</b>“Who despises the day of small things? Men will rejoice when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel.<br/>“(These seven are the eyes of the Lord, which range throughout the earth.)”</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>Then I asked the angel, “What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?”</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>Again I asked him, “What are these two olive branches beside the two gold pipes that pour out golden oil?”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>13</b>He replied, “Do you not know what these are?”<br/>“No, my lord,” I said.</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>So he said, “These are the two who are anointed to serve the Lord of all the earth.”</span></p>

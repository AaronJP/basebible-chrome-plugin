<h1>2 Samuel 22</h1><h2>David's Song of Praise</h2><p><span><b>1</b>David sang to the Lord the words of this song when the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>2</b>He said:<br/>“The Lord is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer;</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge,<br/>my shield and the horn of my salvation.<br/>He is my stronghold, my refuge and my savior—<br/>from violent men you save me.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>I call to the Lord, who is worthy of praise,<br/>and I am saved from my enemies.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>“The waves of death swirled about me;<br/>the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>6</b>The cords of the grave coiled around me;<br/>the snares of death confronted me.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>In my distress I called to the Lord;<br/>I called out to my God.<br/>From his temple he heard my voice;<br/>my cry came to his ears.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>“The earth trembled and quaked,<br/>the foundations of the heavens shook;<br/>they trembled because he was angry.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>Smoke rose from his nostrils;<br/>consuming fire came from his mouth,<br/>burning coals blazed out of it.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>10</b>He parted the heavens and came down;<br/>dark clouds were under his feet.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>11</b>He mounted the cherubim and flew;<br/>he soared on the wings of the wind.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>12</b>He made darkness his canopy around him—<br/>the dark rain clouds of the sky.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>13</b>Out of the brightness of his presence<br/>bolts of lightning blazed forth.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>14</b>The Lord thundered from heaven;<br/>the voice of the Most High resounded.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>15</b>He shot arrows and scattered<i> the enemies</i>,<br/>bolts of lightning and routed them.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>The valleys of the sea were exposed<br/>and the foundations of the earth laid bare<br/>at the rebuke of the Lord,<br/>at the blast of breath from his nostrils.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>17</b>“He reached down from on high and took hold of me;<br/>he drew me out of deep waters.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>18</b>He rescued me from my powerful enemy,<br/>from my foes, who were too strong for me.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>19</b>They confronted me in the day of my disaster,<br/>but the Lord was my support.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>He brought me out into a spacious place;<br/>he rescued me because he delighted in me.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>21</b>“The Lord has dealt with me according to my righteousness;<br/>according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>22</b>For I have kept the ways of the Lord;<br/>I have not done evil by turning from my God.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>23</b>All his laws are before me;<br/>I have not turned away from his decrees.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>24</b>I have been blameless before him<br/>and have kept myself from sin.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>25</b>The Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness,<br/>according to my cleanness in his sight.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>26</b>“To the faithful you show yourself faithful,<br/>to the blameless you show yourself blameless,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>27</b>to the pure you show yourself pure,<br/>but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>28</b>You save the humble,<br/>but your eyes are on the haughty to bring them low.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>29</b>You are my lamp, O Lord;<br/>the Lord turns my darkness into light.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>30</b>With your help I can advance against a troop;<br/>with my God I can scale a wall.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>31</b>“As for God, his way is perfect;<br/>the word of the Lord is flawless.<br/>He is a shield<br/>for all who take refuge in him.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>32</b>For who is God besides the Lord?<br/>And who is the Rock except our God?</span></p><p/><p><span><b>33</b>It is God who arms me with strength<br/>and makes my way perfect.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>34</b>He makes my feet like the feet of a deer;<br/>he enables me to stand on the heights.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>35</b>He trains my hands for battle;<br/>my arms can bend a bow of bronze.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>36</b>You give me your shield of victory;<br/>you stoop down to make me great.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>37</b>You broaden the path beneath me,<br/>so that my ankles do not turn.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>38</b>“I pursued my enemies and crushed them;<br/>I did not turn back till they were destroyed.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>39</b>I crushed them completely, and they could not rise;<br/>they fell beneath my feet.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>40</b>You armed me with strength for battle;<br/>you made my adversaries bow at my feet.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>41</b>You made my enemies turn their backs in flight,<br/>and I destroyed my foes.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>42</b>They cried for help, but there was no one to save them—<br/>to the Lord, but he did not answer.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>43</b>I beat them as fine as the dust of the earth;<br/>I pounded and trampled them like mud in the streets.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>44</b>“You have delivered me from the attacks of my people;<br/>you have preserved me as the head of nations.<br/>People I did not know are subject to me,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>45</b>and foreigners come cringing to me;<br/>as soon as they hear me, they obey me.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>46</b>They all lose heart;<br/>they come trembling from their strongholds.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>47</b>“The Lord lives! Praise be to my Rock!<br/>Exalted be God, the Rock, my Savior!</span></p><p/><p><span><b>48</b>He is the God who avenges me,<br/>who puts the nations under me,</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>49</b>who sets me free from my enemies.<br/>You exalted me above my foes;<br/>from violent men you rescued me.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>50</b>Therefore I will praise you, O Lord, among the nations;<br/>I will sing praises to your name.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>51</b>He gives his king great victories;<br/>he shows unfailing kindness to his anointed,<br/>to David and his descendants forever.”</span></p>

<h1>Isaiah 40</h1><h2>Comfort for God's People</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Comfort, comfort my people,<br/>says your God.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,<br/>and proclaim to her<br/>that her hard service has been completed,<br/>that her sin has been paid for,<br/>that she has received from the Lord's hand<br/>double for all her sins.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>A voice of one calling:<br/>“In the desert prepare<br/>the way for the Lord;<br/>make straight in the wilderness<br/>a highway for our God.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>Every valley shall be raised up,<br/>every mountain and hill made low;<br/>the rough ground shall become level,<br/>the rugged places a plain.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>And the glory of the Lord will be revealed,<br/>and all mankind together will see it.<br/>For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>A voice says, “Cry out.”<br/>And I said, “What shall I cry?”<br/><br/>“All men are like grass,<br/>and all their glory is like the flowers of the field.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>The grass withers and the flowers fall,<br/>because the breath of the Lord blows on them.<br/>Surely the people are grass.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>The grass withers and the flowers fall,<br/>but the word of our God stands forever.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>You who bring good tidings to Zion,<br/>go up on a high mountain.<br/>You who bring good tidings to Jerusalem,<br/>lift up your voice with a shout,<br/>lift it up, do not be afraid;<br/>say to the towns of Judah,<br/>“Here is your God!”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>See, the Sovereign Lord comes with power,<br/>and his arm rules for him.<br/>See, his reward is with him,<br/>and his recompense accompanies him.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>He tends his flock like a shepherd:<br/>He gathers the lambs in his arms<br/>and carries them close to his heart;<br/>he gently leads those that have young.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,<br/>or with the breadth of his hand marked off the heavens?<br/>Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket,<br/>or weighed the mountains on the scales<br/>and the hills in a balance?</span></p><p/><p><span><b>13</b>Who has understood the mind of the Lord,<br/>or instructed him as his counselor?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>Whom did the Lord consult to enlighten him,<br/>and who taught him the right way?<br/>Who was it that taught him knowledge<br/>or showed him the path of understanding?</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket;<br/>they are regarded as dust on the scales;<br/>he weighs the islands as though they were fine dust.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>16</b>Lebanon is not sufficient for altar fires,<br/>nor its animals enough for burnt offerings.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>Before him all the nations are as nothing;<br/>they are regarded by him as worthless<br/>and less than nothing.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>18</b>To whom, then, will you compare God?<br/>What image will you compare him to?</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>As for an idol, a craftsman casts it,<br/>and a goldsmith overlays it with gold<br/>and fashions silver chains for it.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>A man too poor to present such an offering<br/>selects wood that will not rot.<br/>He looks for a skilled craftsman<br/>to set up an idol that will not topple.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>21</b>Do you not know?<br/>Have you not heard?<br/>Has it not been told you from the beginning?<br/>Have you not understood since the earth was founded?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>22</b>He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth,<br/>and its people are like grasshoppers.<br/>He stretches out the heavens like a canopy,<br/>and spreads them out like a tent to live in.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>23</b>He brings princes to naught<br/>and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>24</b>No sooner are they planted,<br/>no sooner are they sown,<br/>no sooner do they take root in the ground,<br/>than he blows on them and they wither,<br/>and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>25</b>“To whom will you compare me?<br/>Or who is my equal?” says the Holy One.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>26</b>Lift your eyes and look to the heavens:<br/>Who created all these?<br/>He who brings out the starry host one by one,<br/>and calls them each by name.<br/>Because of his great power and mighty strength,<br/>not one of them is missing.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>27</b>Why do you say, O Jacob,<br/>and complain, O Israel,<br/>“My way is hidden from the Lord;<br/>my cause is disregarded by my God”?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>28</b>Do you not know?<br/>Have you not heard?<br/>The Lord is the everlasting God,<br/>the Creator of the ends of the earth.<br/>He will not grow tired or weary,<br/>and his understanding no one can fathom.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>29</b>He gives strength to the weary<br/>and increases the power of the weak.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>30</b>Even youths grow tired and weary,<br/>and young men stumble and fall;</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>31</b>but those who hope in the Lord<br/>will renew their strength.<br/>They will soar on wings like eagles;<br/>they will run and not grow weary,<br/>they will walk and not be faint.</span></p>

<h1>Amos 7</h1><h2>Locusts, Fire and a Plumb Line</h2><p><span><b>1</b>This is what the Sovereign Lord showed me: He was preparing swarms of locusts after the king's share had been harvested and just as the second crop was coming up.</span></p><p><span><b>2</b>When they had stripped the land clean, I cried out, “Sovereign Lord, forgive! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>So the Lord relented.<br/>“This will not happen,” the Lord said.</span><span><b>4</b>This is what the Sovereign Lord showed me: The Sovereign Lord was calling for judgment by fire; it dried up the great deep and devoured the land.</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>Then I cried out, “Sovereign Lord, I beg you, stop! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>So the Lord relented.<br/>“This will not happen either,” the Sovereign Lord said.</span><span><b>7</b>This is what he showed me: The Lord was standing by a wall that had been built true to plumb, with a plumb line in his hand.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>And the Lord asked me, “What do you see, Amos?”<br/>“A plumb line,” I replied.<br/>Then the Lord said, “Look, I am setting a plumb line among my people Israel; I will spare them no longer.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>“The high places of Isaac will be destroyed<br/>and the sanctuaries of Israel will be ruined;<br/>with my sword I will rise against the house of Jeroboam.”</span></p><h2>Amos and Amaziah</h2><p><span><b>10</b>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel: “Amos is raising a conspiracy against you in the very heart of Israel. The land cannot bear all his words.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>For this is what Amos is saying:<br/>“ ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword,<br/>and Israel will surely go into exile,<br/>away from their native land.’ ”</span><span><b>12</b>Then Amaziah said to Amos, “Get out, you seer! Go back to the land of Judah. Earn your bread there and do your prophesying there.</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>Don't prophesy anymore at Bethel, because this is the king's sanctuary and the temple of the kingdom.”</span><span><b>14</b>Amos answered Amaziah, “I was neither a prophet nor a prophet's son, but I was a shepherd, and I also took care of sycamore-fig trees.</span><span><b>15</b>But the Lord took me from tending the flock and said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>Now then, hear the word of the Lord. You say,<br/>“ ‘Do not prophesy against Israel,<br/>and stop preaching against the house of Isaac.’</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>“Therefore this is what the Lord says:<br/>“ ‘Your wife will become a prostitute in the city,<br/>and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword.<br/>Your land will be measured and divided up,<br/>and you yourself will die in a pagan country.<br/>And Israel will certainly go into exile,<br/>away from their native land.’ ”</span></p>

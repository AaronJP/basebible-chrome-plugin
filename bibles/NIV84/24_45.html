<h1>Jeremiah 45</h1><h2>A Message to Baruch</h2><p><span><b>1</b>This is what Jeremiah the prophet told Baruch son of Neriah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, after Baruch had written on a scroll the words Jeremiah was then dictating:</span><span><b>2</b>“This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch:</span></p><p><span><b>3</b>You said, ‘Woe to me! The Lord has added sorrow to my pain; I am worn out with groaning and find no rest.’ ”</span><span><b>4</b><i> The</i><i> Lord</i><i> said,</i>“Say this to him: ‘This is what the Lord says: I will overthrow what I have built and uproot what I have planted, throughout the land.</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>Should you then seek great things for yourself? Seek them not. For I will bring disaster on all people, declares the Lord, but wherever you go I will let you escape with your life.’ ”</span></p>

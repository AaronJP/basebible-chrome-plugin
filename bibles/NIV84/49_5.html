<h1>Ephesians 5</h1><p><span><b>1</b>Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children</span></p><p><span><b>2</b>and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.</span><span><b>3</b>But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God's holy people.</span><span><b>4</b>Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.</span><span><b>5</b>For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person–such a man is an idolater–has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</span><span><b>6</b>Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>Therefore do not be partners with them.</span><span><b>8</b>For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light</span><span><b>9</b>(for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth)</span><span><b>10</b>and find out what pleases the Lord.</span><span><b>11</b>Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.</span><span><b>12</b>For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.</span><span><b>13</b>But everything exposed by the light becomes visible,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>for it is light that makes everything visible. This is why it is said:<br/>“Wake up, O sleeper,<br/>rise from the dead,<br/>and Christ will shine on you.”</span><span><b>15</b>Be very careful, then, how you live–not as unwise but as wise,</span><span><b>16</b>making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.</span><span><b>17</b>Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.</span><span><b>18</b>Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.</span><span><b>19</b>Speak to one another with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord,</span></p><p><span><b>20</b>always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.</span></p><h2>Wives and Husbands</h2><p><span><b>22</b>Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.</span><span><b>23</b>For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.</span></p><p><span><b>24</b>Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.</span><span><b>25</b>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her</span><span><b>26</b>to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,</span><span><b>27</b>and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.</span><span><b>28</b>In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.</span><span><b>29</b>After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church–</span><span><b>30</b>for we are members of his body.</span><span><b>31</b>“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”</span><span><b>32</b>This is a profound mystery–but I am talking about Christ and the church.</span></p><p><span><b>33</b>However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.</span></p>

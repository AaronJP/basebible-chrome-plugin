<h1>Matthew 3</h1><h2>John the Baptist Prepares the Way</h2><p><span><b>1</b>In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the Desert of Judea</span><span><b>2</b>and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah:<br/>“A voice of one calling in the desert,<br/>‘Prepare the way for the Lord,<br/>make straight paths for him.’ ”</span><span><b>4</b>John's clothes were made of camel's hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.</span><span><b>5</b>People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan.</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</span><span><b>7</b>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them: “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</span><span><b>8</b>Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.</span><span><b>9</b>And do not think you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.</span><span><b>11</b>“I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me will come one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not fit to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”</span></p><h2>The Baptism of Jesus</h2><p><span><b>13</b>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>But John tried to deter him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?”</span></p><p><span><b>15</b>Jesus replied, “Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness.” Then John consented.</span><span><b>16</b>As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.</span></p><p><span><b>17</b>And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”</span></p>

<h1>Acts 11</h1><h2>Peter Explains His Actions</h2><p><span><b>1</b>The apostles and the brothers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.</span><span><b>2</b>So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him</span></p><p><span><b>3</b>and said, “You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them.”</span><span><b>4</b>Peter began and explained everything to them precisely as it had happened:</span><span><b>5</b>“I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was.</span><span><b>6</b>I looked into it and saw four‑footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the air.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>Then I heard a voice telling me, ‘Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.’</span></p><p><span><b>8</b>“I replied, ‘Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’</span><span><b>9</b>“The voice spoke from heaven a second time, ‘Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.’</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>This happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again.</span><span><b>11</b>“Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying.</span><span><b>12</b>The Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man's house.</span><span><b>13</b>He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say, ‘Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.’</span><span><b>15</b>“As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning.</span><span><b>16</b>Then I remembered what the Lord had said: ‘John baptized withwater, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’</span></p><p><span><b>17</b>So if God gave them the same gift as he gave us, who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could oppose God?”</span></p><p><span><b>18</b>When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, “So then, God has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life.”</span></p><h2>The Church in Antioch</h2><p><span><b>19</b>Now those who had been scattered by the persecution in connection with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, telling the message only to Jews.</span><span><b>20</b>Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus.</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>The Lord's hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.</span><span><b>22</b>News of this reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.</span><span><b>23</b>When he arrived and saw the evidence of the grace of God, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts.</span></p><p><span><b>24</b>He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.</span><span><b>25</b>Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,</span></p><p><span><b>26</b>and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.</span><span><b>27</b>During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</span><span><b>28</b>One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.)</span><span><b>29</b>The disciples, each according to his ability, decided to provide help for the brothers living in Judea.</span></p><p><span><b>30</b>This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.</span></p>

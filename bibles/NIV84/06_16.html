<h1>Joshua 16</h1><h2>Allotment for Ephraim and Manasseh</h2><p><span><b>1</b>The allotment for Joseph began at the Jordan of Jericho,east of the waters of Jericho, and went up from there through the desert into the hill country of Bethel.</span><span><b>2</b>It went on from Bethel (that is, Luz), crossed over to the territory of the Arkites in Ataroth,</span><span><b>3</b>descended westward to the territory of the Japhletites as far as the region of Lower Beth Horon and on to Gezer, ending at the sea.</span></p><p><span><b>4</b>So Manasseh and Ephraim, the descendants of Joseph, received their inheritance.</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>This was the territory of Ephraim, clan by clan:<br/>The boundary of their inheritance went from Ataroth Addar in the east to Upper Beth Horon</span><span><b>6</b>and continued to the sea. From Micmethath on the north it curved eastward to Taanath Shiloh, passing by it to Janoah on the east.</span><span><b>7</b>Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and Naarah, touched Jericho and came out at the Jordan.</span><span><b>8</b>From Tappuah the border went west to the Kanah Ravine and ended at the sea. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the Ephraimites, clan by clan.</span><span><b>9</b>It also included all the towns and their villages that were set aside for the Ephraimites within the inheritance of the Manassites.</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>They did not dislodge the Canaanites living in Gezer; to this day the Canaanites live among the people of Ephraim but are required to do forced labor.</span></p>

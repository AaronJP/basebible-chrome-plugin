<h1>Psalm 58</h1><h2>For the director of music. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” Of David. A miktam.</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Do you rulers indeed speak justly?<br/>Do you judge uprightly among men?</span></p><p/><p><span><b>2</b>No, in your heart you devise injustice,<br/>and your hands mete out violence on the earth.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>Even from birth the wicked go astray;<br/>from the womb they are wayward and speak lies.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>4</b>Their venom is like the venom of a snake,<br/>like that of a cobra that has stopped its ears,</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>that will not heed the tune of the charmer,<br/>however skillful the enchanter may be.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>6</b>Break the teeth in their mouths, O God;<br/>tear out, O Lord, the fangs of the lions!</span></p><p/><p><span><b>7</b>Let them vanish like water that flows away;<br/>when they draw the bow, let their arrows be blunted.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>Like a slug melting away as it moves along,<br/>like a stillborn child, may they not see the sun.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>9</b>Before your pots can feel<i> the heat of</i>the thorns—<br/>whether they be green or dry—the wicked will be swept away.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>10</b>The righteous will be glad when they are avenged,<br/>when they bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>Then men will say,<br/>“Surely the righteous still are rewarded;<br/>surely there is a God who judges the earth.”</span></p>

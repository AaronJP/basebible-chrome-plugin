<h1>Psalm 78</h1><h2>A maskil of Asaph.</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>O my people, hear my teaching;<br/>listen to the words of my mouth.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>2</b>I will open my mouth in parables,<br/>I will utter hidden things, things from of old—</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>what we have heard and known,<br/>what our fathers have told us.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>We will not hide them from their children;<br/>we will tell the next generation<br/>the praiseworthy deeds of the Lord,<br/>his power, and the wonders he has done.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>He decreed statutes for Jacob<br/>and established the law in Israel,<br/>which he commanded our forefathers<br/>to teach their children,</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>so the next generation would know them,<br/>even the children yet to be born,<br/>and they in turn would tell their children.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>Then they would put their trust in God<br/>and would not forget his deeds<br/>but would keep his commands.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>They would not be like their forefathers—<br/>a stubborn and rebellious generation,<br/>whose hearts were not loyal to God,<br/>whose spirits were not faithful to him.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>9</b>The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows,<br/>turned back on the day of battle;</span></p><p/><p><span><b>10</b>they did not keep God's covenant<br/>and refused to live by his law.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>11</b>They forgot what he had done,<br/>the wonders he had shown them.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>12</b>He did miracles in the sight of their fathers<br/>in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>13</b>He divided the sea and led them through;<br/>he made the water stand firm like a wall.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>14</b>He guided them with the cloud by day<br/>and with light from the fire all night.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>15</b>He split the rocks in the desert<br/>and gave them water as abundant as the seas;</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>16</b>he brought streams out of a rocky crag<br/>and made water flow down like rivers.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>17</b>But they continued to sin against him,<br/>rebelling in the desert against the Most High.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>18</b>They willfully put God to the test<br/>by demanding the food they craved.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>19</b>They spoke against God, saying,<br/>“Can God spread a table in the desert?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>When he struck the rock, water gushed out,<br/>and streams flowed abundantly.<br/>But can he also give us food?<br/>Can he supply meat for his people?”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>21</b>When the Lord heard them, he was very angry;<br/>his fire broke out against Jacob,<br/>and his wrath rose against Israel,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>22</b>for they did not believe in God<br/>or trust in his deliverance.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>23</b>Yet he gave a command to the skies above<br/>and opened the doors of the heavens;</span></p><p/><p><span><b>24</b>he rained down manna for the people to eat,<br/>he gave them the grain of heaven.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>25</b>Men ate the bread of angels;<br/>he sent them all the food they could eat.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>26</b>He let loose the east wind from the heavens<br/>and led forth the south wind by his power.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>27</b>He rained meat down on them like dust,<br/>flying birds like sand on the seashore.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>28</b>He made them come down inside their camp,<br/>all around their tents.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>29</b>They ate till they had more than enough,<br/>for he had given them what they craved.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>30</b>But before they turned from the food they craved,<br/>even while it was still in their mouths,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>31</b>God's anger rose against them;<br/>he put to death the sturdiest among them,<br/>cutting down the young men of Israel.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>32</b>In spite of all this, they kept on sinning;<br/>in spite of his wonders, they did not believe.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>33</b>So he ended their days in futility<br/>and their years in terror.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>34</b>Whenever God slew them, they would seek him;<br/>they eagerly turned to him again.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>35</b>They remembered that God was their Rock,<br/>that God Most High was their Redeemer.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>36</b>But then they would flatter him with their mouths,<br/>lying to him with their tongues;</span></p><p/><p><span><b>37</b>their hearts were not loyal to him,<br/>they were not faithful to his covenant.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>38</b>Yet he was merciful;<br/>he forgave their iniquities<br/>and did not destroy them.<br/>Time after time he restrained his anger<br/>and did not stir up his full wrath.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>39</b>He remembered that they were but flesh,<br/>a passing breeze that does not return.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>40</b>How often they rebelled against him in the desert<br/>and grieved him in the wasteland!</span></p><p/><p><span><b>41</b>Again and again they put God to the test;<br/>they vexed the Holy One of Israel.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>42</b>They did not remember his power—<br/>the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,</span></p><p/><p><span><b>43</b>the day he displayed his miraculous signs in Egypt,<br/>his wonders in the region of Zoan.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>44</b>He turned their rivers to blood;<br/>they could not drink from their streams.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>45</b>He sent swarms of flies that devoured them,<br/>and frogs that devastated them.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>46</b>He gave their crops to the grasshopper,<br/>their produce to the locust.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>47</b>He destroyed their vines with hail<br/>and their sycamore-figs with sleet.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>48</b>He gave over their cattle to the hail,<br/>their livestock to bolts of lightning.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>49</b>He unleashed against them his hot anger,<br/>his wrath, indignation and hostility—<br/>a band of destroying angels.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>50</b>He prepared a path for his anger;<br/>he did not spare them from death<br/>but gave them over to the plague.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>51</b>He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt,<br/>the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>52</b>But he brought his people out like a flock;<br/>he led them like sheep through the desert.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>53</b>He guided them safely, so they were unafraid;<br/>but the sea engulfed their enemies.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>54</b>Thus he brought them to the border of his holy land,<br/>to the hill country his right hand had taken.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>55</b>He drove out nations before them<br/>and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance;<br/>he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>56</b>But they put God to the test<br/>and rebelled against the Most High;<br/>they did not keep his statutes.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>57</b>Like their fathers they were disloyal and faithless,<br/>as unreliable as a faulty bow.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>58</b>They angered him with their high places;<br/>they aroused his jealousy with their idols.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>59</b>When God heard them, he was very angry;<br/>he rejected Israel completely.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>60</b>He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh,<br/>the tent he had set up among men.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>61</b>He sent<i> the ark of</i>his might into captivity,<br/>his splendor into the hands of the enemy.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>62</b>He gave his people over to the sword;<br/>he was very angry with his inheritance.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>63</b>Fire consumed their young men,<br/>and their maidens had no wedding songs;</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>64</b>their priests were put to the sword,<br/>and their widows could not weep.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>65</b>Then the Lord awoke as from sleep,<br/>as a man wakes from the stupor of wine.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>66</b>He beat back his enemies;<br/>he put them to everlasting shame.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>67</b>Then he rejected the tents of Joseph,<br/>he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;</span></p><p/><p><span><b>68</b>but he chose the tribe of Judah,<br/>Mount Zion, which he loved.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>69</b>He built his sanctuary like the heights,<br/>like the earth that he established forever.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>70</b>He chose David his servant<br/>and took him from the sheep pens;</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>71</b>from tending the sheep he brought him<br/>to be the shepherd of his people Jacob,<br/>of Israel his inheritance.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>72</b>And David shepherded them with integrity of heart;<br/>with skillful hands he led them.</span></p>

<h1>Psalm 36</h1><h2>For the director of music. Of David the servant of the Lord.</h2><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>An oracle is within my heart<br/>concerning the sinfulness of the wicked:<br/>There is no fear of God<br/>before his eyes.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>2</b>For in his own eyes he flatters himself<br/>too much to detect or hate his sin.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful;<br/>he has ceased to be wise and to do good.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>Even on his bed he plots evil;<br/>he commits himself to a sinful course<br/>and does not reject what is wrong.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>Your love, O Lord, reaches to the heavens,<br/>your faithfulness to the skies.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains,<br/>your justice like the great deep.<br/>O Lord, you preserve both man and beast.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>How priceless is your unfailing love!<br/>Both high and low among men<br/>find refuge in the shadow of your wings.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>8</b>They feast on the abundance of your house;<br/>you give them drink from your river of delights.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>For with you is the fountain of life;<br/>in your light we see light.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>10</b>Continue your love to those who know you,<br/>your righteousness to the upright in heart.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>11</b>May the foot of the proud not come against me,<br/>nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>12</b>See how the evildoers lie fallenâ€”<br/>thrown down, not able to rise!</span></p>

<h1>Galatians 6</h1><h2>Doing Good to All</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.</span><span><b>2</b>Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.</span><span><b>3</b>If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</span><span><b>4</b>Each one should test his own actions. Then he can take pride in himself, without comparing himself to somebody else,</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>for each one should carry his own load.</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>Anyone who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with his instructor.</span><span><b>7</b>Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.</span><span><b>8</b>The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that naturewill reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.</span><span><b>9</b>Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.</span></p><h2>Not Circumcision but a New Creation</h2><p/><p><span><b>11</b>See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand!</span><span><b>12</b>Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.</span><span><b>13</b>Not even those who are circumcised obey the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your flesh.</span><span><b>14</b>May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</span><span><b>15</b>Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is a new creation.</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule, even to the Israel of God.</span></p><p><span><b>17</b>Finally, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.</span><span><b>18</b>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.</span></p>

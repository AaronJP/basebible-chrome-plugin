<h1>Genesis 11</h1><h2>The Tower of Babel</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Now the whole world had one language and a common speech.</span></p><p><span><b>2</b>As men moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there.</span><span><b>3</b>They said to each other, “Come, let's make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar.</span></p><p><span><b>4</b>Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”</span><span><b>5</b>But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower that the men were building.</span><span><b>6</b>The Lord said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.”</span><span><b>8</b>So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city.</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>That is why it was called Babel—because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth.</span></p><h2>From Shem to Abram</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>This is the account of Shem.<br/><br/>Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father of Arphaxad.</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>And after he became the father of Arphaxad, Shem lived 500 years and had other sons and daughters.</span><span><b>12</b>When Arphaxad had lived 35 years, he became the father of Shelah.</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>And after he became the father of Shelah, Arphaxad lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.</span><span><b>14</b>When Shelah had lived 30 years, he became the father of Eber.</span></p><p><span><b>15</b>And after he became the father of Eber, Shelah lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.</span><span><b>16</b>When Eber had lived 34 years, he became the father of Peleg.</span></p><p><span><b>17</b>And after he became the father of Peleg, Eber lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters.</span><span><b>18</b>When Peleg had lived 30 years, he became the father of Reu.</span></p><p><span><b>19</b>And after he became the father of Reu, Peleg lived 209 years and had other sons and daughters.</span><span><b>20</b>When Reu had lived 32 years, he became the father of Serug.</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>And after he became the father of Serug, Reu lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters.</span><span><b>22</b>When Serug had lived 30 years, he became the father of Nahor.</span></p><p><span><b>23</b>And after he became the father of Nahor, Serug lived 200 years and had other sons and daughters.</span><span><b>24</b>When Nahor had lived 29 years, he became the father of Terah.</span></p><p><span><b>25</b>And after he became the father of Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>26</b>After Terah had lived 70 years, he became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>27</b>This is the account of Terah.<br/><br/>Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran.

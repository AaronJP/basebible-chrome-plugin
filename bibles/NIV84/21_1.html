<h1>Ecclesiastes 1</h1><h2>Everything Is Meaningless</h2><p/><p><span><b>1</b>The words of the Teacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem:</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>“Meaningless! Meaningless!”<br/>says the Teacher.<br/>“Utterly meaningless!<br/>Everything is meaningless.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>What does man gain from all his labor<br/>at which he toils under the sun?</span></p><p/><p><span><b>4</b>Generations come and generations go,<br/>but the earth remains forever.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>The sun rises and the sun sets,<br/>and hurries back to where it rises.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>The wind blows to the south<br/>and turns to the north;<br/>round and round it goes,<br/>ever returning on its course.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>All streams flow into the sea,<br/>yet the sea is never full.<br/>To the place the streams come from,<br/>there they return again.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>All things are wearisome,<br/>more than one can say.<br/>The eye never has enough of seeing,<br/>nor the ear its fill of hearing.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>What has been will be again,<br/>what has been done will be done again;<br/>there is nothing new under the sun.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>Is there anything of which one can say,<br/>“Look! This is something new”?<br/>It was here already, long ago;<br/>it was here before our time.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>There is no remembrance of men of old,<br/>and even those who are yet to come<br/>will not be remembered<br/>by those who follow.</span></p><h2>Wisdom Is Meaningless</h2><p><span><b>12</b>I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</span><span><b>13</b>I devoted myself to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a heavy burden God has laid on men!</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>15</b>What is twisted cannot be straightened;<br/>what is lacking cannot be counted.</span><span><b>16</b>I thought to myself, “Look, I have grown and increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge.”</span></p><p><span><b>17</b>Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>18</b>For with much wisdom comes much sorrow;<br/>the more knowledge, the more grief.</span></p>

<h1>Isaiah 53</h1><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Who has believed our message<br/>and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>He grew up before him like a tender shoot,<br/>and like a root out of dry ground.<br/>He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him,<br/>nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>He was despised and rejected by men,<br/>a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering.<br/>Like one from whom men hide their faces<br/>he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>Surely he took up our infirmities<br/>and carried our sorrows,<br/>yet we considered him stricken by God,<br/>smitten by him, and afflicted.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>But he was pierced for our transgressions,<br/>he was crushed for our iniquities;<br/>the punishment that brought us peace was upon him,<br/>and by his wounds we are healed.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>We all, like sheep, have gone astray,<br/>each of us has turned to his own way;<br/>and the Lord has laid on him<br/>the iniquity of us all.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>He was oppressed and afflicted,<br/>yet he did not open his mouth;<br/>he was led like a lamb to the slaughter,<br/>and as a sheep before her shearers is silent,<br/>so he did not open his mouth.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>By oppression and judgment he was taken away.<br/>And who can speak of his descendants?<br/>For he was cut off from the land of the living;<br/>for the transgression of my people he was stricken.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>He was assigned a grave with the wicked,<br/>and with the rich in his death,<br/>though he had done no violence,<br/>nor was any deceit in his mouth.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>Yet it was the Lord's will to crush him and cause him to suffer,<br/>and though the Lord makes his life a guilt offering,<br/>he will see his offspring and prolong his days,<br/>and the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>11</b>After the suffering of his soul,<br/>he will see the light<i> of life</i>and be satisfied;<br/>by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many,<br/>and he will bear their iniquities.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>Therefore I will give him a portion among the great,<br/>and he will divide the spoils with the strong,<br/>because he poured out his life unto death,<br/>and was numbered with the transgressors.<br/>For he bore the sin of many,<br/>and made intercession for the transgressors.</span></p>

<h1>Psalm 70</h1><h2>For the director of music. Of David. A petition.</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Hasten, O God, to save me;<br/>O Lord, come quickly to help me.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>May those who seek my life<br/>be put to shame and confusion;<br/>may all who desire my ruin<br/>be turned back in disgrace.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>3</b>May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!”<br/>turn back because of their shame.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>But may all who seek you<br/>rejoice and be glad in you;<br/>may those who love your salvation always say,<br/>“Let God be exalted!”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>Yet I am poor and needy;<br/>come quickly to me, O God.<br/>You are my help and my deliverer;<br/>O Lord, do not delay.</span></p>

<h1>Psalm 35</h1><h2>Of David.</h2><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Contend, O Lord, with those who contend with me;<br/>fight against those who fight against me.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>2</b>Take up shield and buckler;<br/>arise and come to my aid.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>Brandish spear and javelin<br/>against those who pursue me.<br/>Say to my soul,<br/>“I am your salvation.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>May those who seek my life<br/>be disgraced and put to shame;<br/>may those who plot my ruin<br/>be turned back in dismay.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>5</b>May they be like chaff before the wind,<br/>with the angel of the Lord driving them away;</span></p><p/><p><span><b>6</b>may their path be dark and slippery,<br/>with the angel of the Lord pursuing them.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>7</b>Since they hid their net for me without cause<br/>and without cause dug a pit for me,</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>may ruin overtake them by surprise—<br/>may the net they hid entangle them,<br/>may they fall into the pit, to their ruin.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>9</b>Then my soul will rejoice in the Lord<br/>and delight in his salvation.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>My whole being will exclaim,<br/>“Who is like you, O Lord?<br/>You rescue the poor from those too strong for them,<br/>the poor and needy from those who rob them.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>11</b>Ruthless witnesses come forward;<br/>they question me on things I know nothing about.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>12</b>They repay me evil for good<br/>and leave my soul forlorn.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>Yet when they were ill, I put on sackcloth<br/>and humbled myself with fasting.<br/>When my prayers returned to me unanswered,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>I went about mourning<br/>as though for my friend or brother.<br/>I bowed my head in grief<br/>as though weeping for my mother.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee;<br/>attackers gathered against me when I was unaware.<br/>They slandered me without ceasing.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>16</b>Like the ungodly they maliciously mocked;<br/>they gnashed their teeth at me.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>O Lord, how long will you look on?<br/>Rescue my life from their ravages,<br/>my precious life from these lions.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>18</b>I will give you thanks in the great assembly;<br/>among throngs of people I will praise you.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>19</b>Let not those gloat over me<br/>who are my enemies without cause;<br/>let not those who hate me without reason<br/>maliciously wink the eye.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>20</b>They do not speak peaceably,<br/>but devise false accusations<br/>against those who live quietly in the land.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>21</b>They gape at me and say, “Aha! Aha!<br/>With our own eyes we have seen it.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>22</b>O Lord, you have seen this; be not silent.<br/>Do not be far from me, O Lord.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>23</b>Awake, and rise to my defense!<br/>Contend for me, my God and Lord.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>24</b>Vindicate me in your righteousness, O Lord my God;<br/>do not let them gloat over me.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>25</b>Do not let them think, “Aha, just what we wanted!”<br/>or say, “We have swallowed him up.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>26</b>May all who gloat over my distress<br/>be put to shame and confusion;<br/>may all who exalt themselves over me<br/>be clothed with shame and disgrace.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>27</b>May those who delight in my vindication<br/>shout for joy and gladness;<br/>may they always say, “The Lord be exalted,<br/>who delights in the well-being of his servant.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>28</b>My tongue will speak of your righteousness<br/>and of your praises all day long.</span></p>

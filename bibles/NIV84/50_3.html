<h1>Philippians 3</h1><h2>No Confidence in the Flesh</h2><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you.</span><span><b>2</b>Watch out for those dogs, those men who do evil, those mutilators of the flesh.</span><span><b>3</b>For it is we who are the circumcision, we who worship by the Spirit of God, who glory in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh–</span></p><p><span><b>4</b>though I myself have reasons for such confidence.<br/>If anyone else thinks he has reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more:</span><span><b>5</b>circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee;</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for legalistic righteousness, faultless.</span><span><b>7</b>But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.</span><span><b>8</b>What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ</span><span><b>9</b>and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ–the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith.</span><span><b>10</b>I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection from the dead.</span></p><h2>Pressing on Toward the Goal</h2><p><span><b>12</b>Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.</span><span><b>13</b>Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.</span><span><b>15</b>All of us who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you.</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>Only let us live up to what we have already attained.</span><span><b>17</b>Join with others in following my example, brothers, and take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you.</span><span><b>18</b>For, as I have often told you before and now say again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.</span><span><b>19</b>Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is on earthly things.</span><span><b>20</b>But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.</span></p>

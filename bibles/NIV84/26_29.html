<h1>Ezekiel 29</h1><h2>A Prophecy Against Egypt</h2><p><span><b>1</b>In the tenth year, in the tenth month on the twelfth day, the word of the LORD came to me:</span><span><b>2</b>“Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>Speak to him and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says:<br/>“ ‘I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt,<br/>you great monster lying among your streams.<br/>You say, “The Nile is mine;<br/>I made it for myself.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>But I will put hooks in your jaws<br/>and make the fish of your streams stick to your scales.<br/>I will pull you out from among your streams,<br/>with all the fish sticking to your scales.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>I will leave you in the desert,<br/>you and all the fish of your streams.<br/>You will fall on the open field<br/>and not be gathered or picked up.<br/>I will give you as food<br/>to the beasts of the earth and the birds of the air.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>6</b>Then all who live in Egypt will know that I am the LORD.<br/><br/>“ ‘You have been a staff of reed for the house of Israel.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>When they grasped you with their hands, you splintered and you tore open their shoulders; when they leaned on you, you broke and their backs were wrenched.</span><span><b>8</b>” ‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will bring a sword against you and kill your men and their animals.</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>Egypt will become a desolate wasteland. Then they will know that I am the LORD.<br/>“ ‘Because you said, “The Nile is mine; I made it,”</span><span><b>10</b>therefore I am against you and against your streams, and I will make the land of Egypt a ruin and a desolate waste from Migdol to Aswan, as far as the border of Cush.</span><span><b>11</b>No foot of man or animal will pass through it; no one will live there for forty years.</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>I will make the land of Egypt desolate among devastated lands, and her cities will lie desolate forty years among ruined cities. And I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them through the countries.</span><span><b>13</b>” ‘Yet this is what the Sovereign LORD says: At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the nations where they were scattered.</span><span><b>14</b>I will bring them back from captivity and return them to Upper Egypt, the land of their ancestry. There they will be a lowly kingdom.</span><span><b>15</b>It will be the lowliest of kingdoms and will never again exalt itself above the other nations. I will make it so weak that it will never again rule over the nations.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>16</b>Egypt will no longer be a source of confidence for the people of Israel but will be a reminder of their sin in turning to her for help. Then they will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.’ ”</span><span><b>17</b>In the twenty-seventh year, in the first month on the first day, the word of the LORD came to me:</span><span><b>18</b>“Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon drove his army in a hard campaign against Tyre; every head was rubbed bare and every shoulder made raw. Yet he and his army got no reward from the campaign he led against Tyre.</span><span><b>19</b>Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am going to give Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will carry off its wealth. He will loot and plunder the land as pay for his army.</span></p><p><span><b>20</b>I have given him Egypt as a reward for his efforts because he and his army did it for me, declares the Sovereign LORD.</span></p><p><span><b>21</b>“On that day I will make a horn grow for the house of Israel, and I will open your mouth among them. Then they will know that I am the LORD.”</span></p>

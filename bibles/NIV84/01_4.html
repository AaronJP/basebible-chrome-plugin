<h1>Genesis 4</h1><h2>Cain and Abel</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Adam lay with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, “With the help of the Lord I have brought forth a man.”</span></p><p><span><b>2</b>Later she gave birth to his brother Abel.<br/>Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil.</span><span><b>3</b>In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord.</span><span><b>4</b>But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering,</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.</span><span><b>6</b>Then the Lord said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must master it.”</span></p><p><span><b>8</b>Now Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let's go out to the field.” And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>9</b>Then the Lord said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?”<br/>“I don't know,” he replied. “Am I my brother's keeper?”</span><span><b>10</b>The Lord said, “What have you done? Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground.</span><span><b>11</b>Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.”</span><span><b>13</b>Cain said to the Lord, “My punishment is more than I can bear.</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.”</span><span><b>15</b>But the Lord said to him, “Not so; if anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over.” Then the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.</span></p><p><span><b>16</b>So Cain went out from the Lord's presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.</span><span><b>17</b>Cain lay with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch.</span></p><p><span><b>18</b>To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.</span><span><b>19</b>Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.</span><span><b>20</b>Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.</span><span><b>21</b>His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute.</span></p><p><span><b>22</b>Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>23</b>Lamech said to his wives,<br/>“Adah and Zillah, listen to me;<br/>wives of Lamech, hear my words.<br/>I have killed a man for wounding me,<br/>a young man for injuring me.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>24</b>If Cain is avenged seven times,<br/>then Lamech seventy-seven times.”</span><span><b>25</b>Adam lay with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, “God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>26</b>Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh.<br/>At that time men began to call on the name of the Lord.</span></p>

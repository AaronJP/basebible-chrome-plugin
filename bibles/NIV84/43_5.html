<h1>John 5</h1><h2>The Healing at the Pool</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews.</span><span><b>2</b>Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.</span><span><b>3</b>Here a great number of disabled people used to lie–the blind, the lame, the paralyzed.</span><span><b>5</b>One who was there had been an invalid for thirty‑eight years.</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, “Do you want to get well?”</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>“Sir,” the invalid replied, “I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.”</span><span><b>8</b>Then Jesus said to him, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.”</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked.<br/>The day on which this took place was a Sabbath,</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.”</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>But he replied, “The man who made me well said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’ ”</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>So they asked him, “Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?”</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.</span><span><b>14</b>Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, “See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.”</span></p><p><span><b>15</b>The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</span></p><h2>Life Through the Son</h2><p><span><b>16</b>So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews persecuted him.</span><span><b>17</b>Jesus said to them, “My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working.”</span></p><p><span><b>18</b>For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</span><span><b>19</b>Jesus gave them this answer: “I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.</span><span><b>20</b>For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these.</span><span><b>21</b>For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.</span><span><b>22</b>Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,</span></p><p><span><b>23</b>that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.</span><span><b>24</b>“I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life.</span><span><b>25</b>I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.</span><span><b>26</b>For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself.</span></p><p><span><b>27</b>And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.</span><span><b>28</b>“Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice</span><span><b>29</b>and come out–those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.</span></p><p><span><b>30</b>By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.</span></p><h2>Testimonies About Jesus</h2><p><span><b>31</b>“If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid.</span></p><p><span><b>32</b>There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is valid.</span><span><b>33</b>“You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.</span><span><b>34</b>Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved.</span></p><p><span><b>35</b>John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.</span><span><b>36</b>“I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the very work that the Father has given me to finish, and which I am doing, testifies that the Father has sent me.</span><span><b>37</b>And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form,</span><span><b>38</b>nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent.</span><span><b>39</b>You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about me,</span></p><p><span><b>40</b>yet you refuse to come to me to have life.</span><span><b>41</b>“I do not accept praise from men,</span><span><b>42</b>but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts.</span><span><b>43</b>I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.</span></p><p><span><b>44</b>How can you believe if you accept praise from one another, yet make no effort to obtain the praise that comes from the only God?</span><span><b>45</b>“But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set.</span><span><b>46</b>If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.</span></p><p><span><b>47</b>But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?”</span></p>

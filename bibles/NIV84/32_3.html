<h1>Jonah 3</h1><h2>Jonah Goes to Nineveh</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Then the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time:</span></p><p><span><b>2</b>“Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you.”</span><span><b>3</b>Jonah obeyed the word of the Lord and went to Nineveh. Now Nineveh was a very important city—a visit required three days.</span><span><b>4</b>On the first day, Jonah started into the city. He proclaimed: “Forty more days and Nineveh will be overturned.”</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>The Ninevites believed God. They declared a fast, and all of them, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth.</span><span><b>6</b>When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the dust.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>Then he issued a proclamation in Nineveh:<br/><br/>“By the decree of the king and his nobles:<br/><br/>Do not let any man or beast, herd or flock, taste anything; do not let them eat or drink.</span><span><b>8</b>But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth. Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up their evil ways and their violence.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>9</b>Who knows? God may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish.”</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he had compassion and did not bring upon them the destruction he had threatened.</span></p>

<h1>Isaiah 8</h1><h2>Assyria, the Lord's Instrument</h2><p><span><b>1</b>The Lord said to me, “Take a large scroll and write on it with an ordinary pen: Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.</span></p><p><span><b>2</b>And I will call in Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah as reliable witnesses for me.”</span><span><b>3</b>Then I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. And the Lord said to me, “Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.</span></p><p><span><b>4</b>Before the boy knows how to say ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria.”</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>The Lord spoke to me again:</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>“Because this people has rejected<br/>the gently flowing waters of Shiloah<br/>and rejoices over Rezin<br/>and the son of Remaliah,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>therefore the Lord is about to bring against them<br/>the mighty floodwaters of the River—<br/>the king of Assyria with all his pomp.<br/>It will overflow all its channels,<br/>run over all its banks</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>and sweep on into Judah, swirling over it,<br/>passing through it and reaching up to the neck.<br/>Its outspread wings will cover the breadth of your land,<br/>O Immanuel!”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>Raise the war cry, you nations, and be shattered!<br/>Listen, all you distant lands.<br/>Prepare for battle, and be shattered!<br/>Prepare for battle, and be shattered!</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>10</b>Devise your strategy, but it will be thwarted;<br/>propose your plan, but it will not stand,<br/>for God is with us.</span></p><h2>Fear God</h2><p/><p><span><b>11</b>The Lord spoke to me with his strong hand upon me, warning me not to follow the way of this people. He said:</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>12</b>“Do not call conspiracy<br/>everything that these people call conspiracy;<br/>do not fear what they fear,<br/>and do not dread it.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>13</b>The Lord Almighty is the one you are to regard as holy,<br/>he is the one you are to fear,<br/>he is the one you are to dread,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>14</b>and he will be a sanctuary;<br/>but for both houses of Israel he will be<br/>a stone that causes men to stumble<br/>and a rock that makes them fall.<br/>And for the people of Jerusalem he will be<br/>a trap and a snare.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>15</b>Many of them will stumble;<br/>they will fall and be broken,<br/>they will be snared and captured.”</span></p><p/><p><span><b>16</b>Bind up the testimony<br/>and seal up the law among my disciples.</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>17</b>I will wait for the Lord,<br/>who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob.<br/>I will put my trust in him.</span></p><p><span><b>18</b>Here am I, and the children the Lord has given me. We are signs and symbols in Israel from the Lord Almighty, who dwells on Mount Zion.</span><span><b>19</b>When men tell you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?</span><span><b>20</b>To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn.</span><span><b>21</b>Distressed and hungry, they will roam through the land; when they are famished, they will become enraged and, looking upward, will curse their king and their God.</span></p><p><span><b>22</b>Then they will look toward the earth and see only distress and darkness and fearful gloom, and they will be thrust into utter darkness.</span></p>

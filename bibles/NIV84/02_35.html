<h1>Exodus 35</h1><h2>Sabbath Regulations</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Moses assembled the whole Israelite community and said to them, “These are the things the Lord has commanded you to do:</span><span><b>2</b>For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a Sabbath of rest to the Lord. Whoever does any work on it must be put to death.</span></p><p><span><b>3</b>Do not light a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day.”</span></p><h2>Materials for the Tabernacle</h2><p><span><b>4</b>Moses said to the whole Israelite community, “This is what the Lord has commanded:</span><span><b>5</b>From what you have, take an offering for the Lord.

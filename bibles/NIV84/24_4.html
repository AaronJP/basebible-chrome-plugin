<h1>Jeremiah 4</h1><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>“If you will return, O Israel,<br/>return to me,”<br/>declares the Lord.<br/>“If you put your detestable idols out of my sight<br/>and no longer go astray,</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>2</b>and if in a truthful, just and righteous way<br/>you swear, ‘As surely as the Lord lives,’<br/>then the nations will be blessed by him<br/>and in him they will glory.”</span></p><p/><p/><p><span><b>3</b>This is what the Lord says to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem:<br/>“Break up your unplowed ground<br/>and do not sow among thorns.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>4</b>Circumcise yourselves to the Lord,<br/>circumcise your hearts,<br/>you men of Judah and people of Jerusalem,<br/>or my wrath will break out and burn like fire<br/>because of the evil you have done—<br/>burn with no one to quench it.</span></p><h2>Disaster From the North</h2><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>5</b>“Announce in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem and say:<br/>‘Sound the trumpet throughout the land!’<br/>Cry aloud and say:<br/>‘Gather together!<br/>Let us flee to the fortified cities!’</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>6</b>Raise the signal to go to Zion!<br/>Flee for safety without delay!<br/>For I am bringing disaster from the north,<br/>even terrible destruction.”</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>7</b>A lion has come out of his lair;<br/>a destroyer of nations has set out.<br/>He has left his place<br/>to lay waste your land.<br/>Your towns will lie in ruins<br/>without inhabitant.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>8</b>So put on sackcloth,<br/>lament and wail,<br/>for the fierce anger of the Lord<br/>has not turned away from us.</span></p><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>9</b>“In that day,” declares the Lord,<br/>“the king and the officials will lose heart,<br/>the priests will be horrified,<br/>and the prophets will be appalled.”</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>Then I said, “Ah, Sovereign Lord, how completely you have deceived this people and Jerusalem by saying, ‘You will have peace,’ when the sword is at our throats.”</span><span><b>11</b>At that time this people and Jerusalem will be told, “A scorching wind from the barren heights in the desert blows toward my people, but not to winnow or cleanse;</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>a wind too strong for that comes from me.

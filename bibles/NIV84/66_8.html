<h1>Revelation 8</h1><h2>The Seventh Seal and the Golden Censer</h2><p/><p><span><b>1</b>When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.</span></p><p><span><b>2</b>And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and to them were given seven trumpets.</span><span><b>3</b>Another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense to offer, with the prayers of all the saints, on the golden altar before the throne.</span><span><b>4</b>The smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of the saints, went up before God from the angel's hand.</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it on the earth; and there came peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning and an earthquake.</span></p><h2>The Trumpets</h2><p/><p><span><b>6</b>Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled down upon the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.</span><span><b>8</b>The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain, all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood,</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.</span><span><b>10</b>The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water–</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>the name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become bitter.</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them turned dark. A third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night.</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>As I watched, I heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a loud voice: “Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the other three angels!”</span></p>

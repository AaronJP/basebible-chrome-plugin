Do not follow their practices.</span><span><b>4</b>You must obey my laws and be careful to follow my decrees. I am the Lord your God.</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>Keep my decrees and laws, for the man who obeys them will live by them. I am the Lord.</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>“ ‘No one is to approach any close relative to have sexual relations. I am the Lord.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>“ ‘Do not dishonor your father by having sexual relations with your mother. She is your mother; do not have relations with her.</span></p><p><span><b>8</b>“ ‘Do not have sexual relations with your father’s wife; that would dishonor your father.</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>“ ‘Do not have sexual relations with your sister, either your father’s daughter or your mother’s daughter, whether she was born in the same home or elsewhere.</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>“ ‘Do not have sexual relations with your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter; that would dishonor you.</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>“ ‘Do not have sexual relations with the daughter of your father’s wife, born to your father; she is your sister.</span></p><p><span><b>12</b>“ ‘Do not have sexual relations with your father’s sister; she is your father’s close relative.</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>“ ‘Do not have sexual relations with your mother’s sister, because she is your mother’s close relative.</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>“ ‘Do not dishonor your father’s brother by approaching his wife to have sexual relations; she is your aunt.</span></p><p><span><b>15</b>“ ‘Do not have sexual relations with your daughter-in-law.

A woman must not present herself to an animal to have sexual relations with it; that is a perversion.</span><span><b>24</b>“ ‘Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways, because this is how the nations that I am going to drive out before you became defiled.</span><span><b>25</b>Even the land was defiled; so I punished it for its sin, and the land vomited out its inhabitants.</span><span><b>26</b>But you must keep my decrees and my laws. The native-born and the aliens living among you must not do any of these detestable things,</span><span><b>27</b>for all these things were done by the people who lived in the land before you, and the land became defiled.</span></p><p><span><b>28</b>And if you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it vomited out the nations that were before you.</span><span><b>29</b>“ ‘Everyone who does any of these detestable things—such persons must be cut off from their people.</span></p><p><span><b>30</b>Keep my requirements and do not follow any of the detestable customs that were practiced before you came and do not defile yourselves with them. I am the Lord your God.’ ”</span></p>
